Manila. His collegiate education was completed in England and
Switzerland. A long sojourn in Europe has instructed him in European
thought, tendencies, and methods. He has lived in the United States for
many years, and has become, by naturalization, a citizen of this
country.</p>
<p>He collected the historical material for this work largely from the
Spanish archives in Manila before the last rising of the people of
Luzon in rebellion against Spain. His mastery of the English language
is that of the thorough scholar. His qualifications for his work are
those of the student, trained by many studies. He possesses by nativity
the gift, incommunicable to any alien, of giving a true color and duly
proportioned form to his delineations of his own people. These
endowments have enabled him to produce a work of striking and permanent
value.</p>
<p>The most meritorious feature of Mr. Lala&rsquo;s book is
unquestionably its impartiality of statement and judgment. This is
particularly apparent in his descriptions of the moral and intellectual
character of his countrymen. No defect is extenuated, nor is there any
patriotic exaggeration of merits. The capacities and limitations of the
Filipinos are plainly and photographically depicted. The difficulties
and the facilities of their political control by the United States are
weighed in a just balance by the reader himself in considering these
portrayals of national character. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22"
href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span></p>
<p>This colorless truth of statement appears not alone in Mr.
Lala&rsquo;s special descriptions of the character of his people. It is
also manifest, as it is incidentally displayed, in his many expositions
of the systems and methods of labor, of social usages, of domestic
life, of civil administration, of military capacity, of popular
amusements and of religious faith. The result is that he has
communicated to the reader an unusually distinct conception of national
and ethnic character. This is always a very difficult task. The most
graphic portrayal in this respect most commonly enables the reader
merely to perceive indistinctly, but not clearly to see.</p>
<p>The book is of a most practical character. Its statements of
commercial history and methods, and of past and present business and
industrial conditions, are most satisfactory. Such an exposition is at
this time most indispensably needed. Everybody knows, in a general way,
that the Philippine Islands produce sugar, rice, hemp, tobacco, coffee,
and many other agricultural staples, and that they are rich in minerals
and valuable woods. But heretofore it has been very difficult to obtain
specific information upon these subjects. Mr. Lala has given this
information. The practical man, the farmer, the manufacturer, the
merchant, the miner is here informed concerning resources, methods,
prices, labor, wages, profits, and roads. While this information is not
technical, it is instructively full and is evidently reliable.</p>
<p>The descriptions of the processes of cultivating and preparing hemp,
sugar, coffee, rice, and tobacco, and the suggestions of the ways by
which these methods can be easily improved, and the products made more
profitable, are, in every way, most satisfactory.</p>
<p>The Philippines began to come under European control with the
administration of Legaspi, the first Governor-General, in 1565, long
before the English had colonized any portion of North America.</p>
<p>For about three hundred and fifty years the Spanish system has been
in contrast with that of every other colonizing nation. It has been
worse than the worst of any of these. While there is no elaborate
contrast of these systems in Mr. Lala&rsquo;s book, he nevertheless
depicts so thoroughly the manifold and inveterate rapacity, cruelty,
corruption, and imbecility of Spanish colonial administration,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>that he also discloses the vast possibilities of
the better contrasted systems.</p>
<p>No war was ever yet waged in the interests of humanity, as the war
against Spain unquestionably was, that did not produce consequences
entirely unforeseen at its beginning. This truth was never more
convincingly confirmed than by the war just ended. The United States
demanded the evacuation by Spain of Cuba and Cuban waters. Compliance
by Spain would have limited the consequences to the evacuation. She did
not comply. She chose the arbitrament of war, and the result was her
extirpation from her insular possessions in the West Indies and the
Philippines.</p>
<p>This providential and revolutionary event imposed upon the United
States duties unforeseen, but none the less imperious. As to the
Philippines, those duties are complicated by the irresistible
tendencies which seem to make certain the dismemberment of China, and
the subjection of that immemorial empire to all the influences of
Western civilization. This is an event not inferior in importance to
the discovery of America by Columbus, and the interest of the United
States in its consequences is of incalculable importance. With this
interest its relations to the Philippines is inseparably connected, and
those relations present for consideration policies which disenchant the
situation of all idealism and make it intensely practical. To this
possible result the war waged against the United States by Aguinaldo
and his followers has decisively contributed.</p>
<p>But, in any event, whatever the relations of the United States to
the Philippines may finally become, the book of Mr. Lala will
undoubtedly influence and assist the considerate judgment of those
whose duty shall call them to determine the momentous questions which
are now enforcing themselves for solution upon the attention of the
American people.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">About twenty years ago, when a student at St.
John&rsquo;s College, London, I was frequently asked by people I met in
society for information regarding the Philippines and the Filipinos.
Many also, who showed considerable interest, and who wished, for
various reasons, to carry their investigations further, complained that
there was in English no good book on the subject. Afterward, when I
continued my studies at a French college in Ne&ucirc;chatel,
Switzerland, I met with many similar inquiries, and here too in America
I found demand for a comprehensive, reliable work upon my country.</p>
<p>But it was not until I had traveled considerably through Europe,
studying the history of the various States and peoples, that the idea
of writing a history of my own fatherland occurred to me. It was
mortifying then to think that the glories of my native land were no
better known. Accordingly, I resolved to become the chronicler, and I
began at once to collect material for a work on the Philippines, that
should, I trusted, be deemed a permanent contribution to historical
literature.</p>
<p>Upon my return to Manila from Europe, I immediately began a study of
the Colonial archives in the office of the Governor-General. From these
I gathered many valuable data about the early history of the colony,
and also much information that would be locked to the curious traveler.
And on account of my knowledge of Spanish, and because of my friendship
with the Governor-General Moriones, I was enabled to do this
thoroughly. Thus I gradually laid the foundation for the present work.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span></p>
<p>When, a few years later,&mdash;in 1887,&mdash;because of my sympathy
with the rising cause of the insurgents, Spanish tyrants banished me
from my country and my kindred, I carried away all the manuscripts I
had already written, resolved to finish the task I had set before me
amid a more congenial environment.</p>
<p>I came to the United States. Of this country I, in due time, became
a citizen. However, I kept up my relations with friends in Manila; for
I still felt an interest in the fate of my native land. Though I have
since revisited the Orient, I preferred to retain my American
citizenship, rather than again put myself under the iron yoke of Spain.
I have, nevertheless, kept pace with the march of events in the colony,
and had, indeed, about completed my history when Dewey&rsquo;s grand
victory denoted a new era for the Filipinos, and, hence, made the
addition of several chapters necessary. I have thus added much of
supreme interest to Americans; bringing the book to the capture of
Manila by the American forces.</p>
<p>My acquaintance with the leading insurgents,&mdash;Rizal, Aguinaldo,
Agoncillo, the Lunas, and others,&mdash;has also enabled me to speak
with authority about them and the cause for which they have fought.</p>
<p>In writing this work I have consulted all previous historians, the
old Spanish chroniclers, Gaspar de San Agustin, Juan de la Concepcion,
Martinez Zu&ntilde;iga, Bowring, <span class="corr" id="xd21e1482"
title="Source: Forman">Foreman</span>, and various treatises,
anthropological and historical, in French, Spanish, and English.</p>
<p>To all these writers I am indebted for many valuable facts.</p>
<p>It has been my aim to give&mdash;rather than a long, detailed
account&mdash;a concise, but true, comprehensive, and interesting
history of the Philippine Islands; one, too, covering every phase of
the subject, and giving also every important fact.</p>
<p>And my animating spirit of loyalty for my own countrymen makes me
feel that I cannot more clearly and fully manifest my affection for
them and my native land than by writing this book.</p>
<p>Many of the pictures are photographs taken by myself. The rest were
selected from a great number of others, that were accessible, as being
most typical of Philippine life and scenery.</p>
<p>The student of history, and he that would learn something about the
customs of the people, and the natural resources of the country,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>may, I trust, find the perusal of this work not
without profit and interest.</p>
<p>I desire to attest here my gratitude for the many courtesies shown
me, and for the hearty manner in which I have been received, in this
great, free country.</p>
<p>Everywhere it was the same.</p>
<p>And I would say to all loyal, ardent Filipinos, that I believe that
they eventually will not regret the day when Commodore Dewey sundered
the galling chains of Spanish dominance, and when General Merritt,
later, hoisted the Stars and Stripes over the Archipelago.</p>
<p>They will, rather, most surely live to recognize and appreciate the
unsullied manifold advantages and benefits incident to American
occupation and to a close contact with this honest, vigorous type of
manhood.</p>

<h3 class="main">Discovery and Conquest.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When Magellan in the spring of 1521 took formal
possession of Mindanao, one of the largest of the Philippine group, he
was surrounded by crowds of the curious brown-skinned natives of that
island; with sensations of awe, they watched their strange white
visitors, believing them to be angels of light. It was Easter-week, and
the Spanish discoverers, with all the ritualistic splendor of the mass,
dedicated the newly-found islands to God and the Church.</p>
<p>The natives, too, manifested great friendliness to the
tempest-tossed mariners. Indeed, one of their most prominent chieftains
himself piloted the exploring party to Ceb&uacute;, where thousands of
natives, arrayed in all the barbarous paraphernalia of savagery, stood
on the beach, and, with their spears and shields, menaced the
strangers.</p>
<p>The Mindanao chieftain, who had acted as pilot, thereupon went on
shore and volunteered an explanation: these strange voyagers were
seeking rest and provisions, having been many weary months away from
their own country.</p>
<p>A treaty of amity was then ratified according to their native
custom, each party thereto simultaneously drawing and drinking blood
from the breast of the other. Magellan then caused <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>a rude
chapel to be built on this new and hospitable shore, and here the
natives witnessed the first rites of that Church that, within a
century, extended its oppressive sway from one end of the Archipelago
to the other.</p>
<p>The King and Queen of the natives were soon persuaded to accept the
rite of baptism. This they seemed to enjoy greatly. To persuade the
good-natured savages to take the oath of allegiance to the King of
far-away Spain was but a step farther. One ceremony was probably as
intelligible to them as the other; and thus the first two links in the
fetters of the Filipinos had been forged.</p>

alt="The Fortifications of Old Manila." width="698" height="516">
<p class="figureHead">The Fortifications of Old Manila.</p>
</div>
<p>With characteristic arrogance the Spaniards henceforth conducted
themselves as the rightful masters of both the confiding natives and
their opulent country.</p>
<p>It appears, now, that the natives of Ceb&uacute; were engaged in war
with another tribe on the island of Magtan. The adventurous
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>Magellan, beholding an opportunity for conquest,
and, perhaps, for profit, accompanied his allies into battle, where he
was mortally wounded by an arrow.</p>
<p>Thus perished the brave and brilliant discoverer, in the very bloom
of life, when both fame and fortune seemed to have laid their most
precious offerings at his feet.</p>
<p>Posterity has erected a monument on the very spot where this hero
was slain. Ceb&uacute; also boasts an obelisk that commemorates the
discovery; while on the left bank of the Pasig river, Manila, stands
another testimonial to the splendid achievements of the intrepid
Magellan.</p>
<p>Duarte de Barbosa was now chosen leader of the expedition, and he,
with twenty-six companions, was invited to a banquet by Hamabar, the
King of the island. In the midst of the royal festivities the Spaniards
were treacherously murdered. Juan Serrano alone&mdash;so the old
chronicles relate&mdash;was spared. He had, in some way, secured the
favor of the natives, and now, stripped of his clothing and his armor,
he was made to walk up and down the beach, in full view of his
companions on board the ships.</p>
<p>For his person the natives shrewdly demanded a ransom of two of the
Spanish cannon. A consultation was held among the Spaniards, and it was
decided that it was better that one should perish than that the lives
of all be jeoparded. And so Serrano was left to his fate.</p>

<h3 class="main">Adventures of Juan Sebastian Elcano.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Reduced, at last, to about 100 men and two ships, the
Spaniards decided to return home. The captain of one of these&mdash;of
the Victoria&mdash;was Juan Sebastian Elcano. This gallant sailor,
after losing many brave companions and meeting many thrilling
adventures, at last brought his ship safely to a Spanish
port&mdash;three years after he had embarked, <i>en route</i> to the
Moluccas, under his first commander, the unfortunate Magellan.</p>
<p>When Elcano and his seventeen companions landed in Spain,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>they were mere skeletons, so reduced were they by
hunger and disease. Everywhere they were received with acclamations of
joy, and upon their arrival in Seville they straightway proceeded to
the Cathedral, where, amid grand <i lang="la">Te Deums</i>, they gave
thanks to God for their return.</p>
<p>It must, indeed, have been a strange sight to see this remnant,
these gaunt survivors of the splendid company of adventurers that had
left that city but three years before,&mdash;flaming with zeal for the
spread of the Church, and glowing in the desire of
conquest,&mdash;these few half-starved wretches, now walking
barefooted, with lighted candles, through the streets,&mdash;all that
was left of that eager throng.</p>
<p>And yet, pitiable as they were, they must have been conscious of an
achievement that meant glory for their country and immortality for
themselves.</p>
<p>Nor were they unrewarded. All received food and money, and Elcano,
the leader, was voted a life-pension of 500 ducats; and, in token of
his great accomplishment in having first circumnavigated the globe, the
King knighted him, awarding him, as his escutcheon, a globe with the
motto: &ldquo;<i lang="la">Primus circundedit me.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cargo of the Victoria consisted of 26&frac12; tons of cloves and
other spices: cinnamon, sandalwood, nutmegs, and so forth. It is said
that one of the Tidor islanders, brought back with the expedition, who
was presented to the King, was never permitted to return to his home,
because he had committed the blunder of making inquiry regarding the
value of spices in the Spanish markets.</p>
<p>The Trinidad, the other vessel of this remarkable expedition, after
many terrible hardships, fell into the hands of the Portuguese, who
sent the survivors to Lisbon. They reached that port five years after
their departure with Magellan.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm of the Spanish monarch and his subjects on account of
these remarkable discoveries was unbounded. Other expeditions to the
islands were soon fitted out. One, under the leadership of Ruy Lopez de
Villalobos, gave to them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href=
"#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>the name of the Philippine Islands.
This was in honor of Philip, Prince of Austria, the son of King Charles
I., heir-apparent to the throne of Castile; to which, in 1555, upon the
abdication of his father, he succeeded as Philip II.</p>
<p>This bigot, convinced by his religious advisers of the importance of
winning the newly-discovered islands for the Church, caused another
expedition to be fitted out from Navidad, in the South Sea.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="xd21e1596" class="div2 section"><span class=
"pagenum">[<a href="#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Legaspi, the First Governor-General.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Accordingly, Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, a well-known
Basque navigator, of great piety, and with a reputation for probity and
ability, set out with four ships and one frigate, all well armed and
carrying 800 soldiers and sailors. Six priests also accompanied them.
One was Urdaneta, who had formerly sailed as a captain to the Moluccas.
The avowed object of the expedition was to subjugate and to
Christianize the benighted natives of those islands.</p>
<p>After a propitious voyage, not without incident, General Legaspi
resolved to cast anchor at Ceb&uacute;, a safe port. On the way the
ships stopped at the port of Dapitan, on the island of Mindanao. Prince
Pagbuaya, the ruler of this island, was so astonished at the sight of
these large ships off the coast of his country, that he commanded one
of his subjects, who had some reputation for boldness, to observe their
movements and to report his observations.</p>
<p>He did. They were manned, he said, by enormous men with long,
pointed noses; that these strange beings were dressed in fine robes,
and actually ate stones (hard sea-biscuits); most wonderful of all,
they drank fire, and blew smoke out of their mouths and through their
nostrils&mdash;referring, of course, to their drinking and smoking. He
also said that they could command the thunder and the
lightning&mdash;meaning their fire-arms;&mdash;that their proud
bearing, their bearded faces, and splendid attire, moreover, surely
proclaimed them to be gods. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href=
"#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p>Having heard this report, the Prince, accordingly, thought it not
unwise to treat with these wonderful beings. Legaspi not only succeeded
in obtaining provisions&mdash;in barter for European wares&mdash;from
this chief, but he also obtained much useful information about his
destination, Ceb&uacute;. He learnt that it was considered a powerful
kingdom, whose greatness was much feared by other States, and that its
port was not only safe, but also favorably situated.</p>
<p>The General, therefore, determined to annex it to the Crown of
Castile at the earliest opportunity. He landed at Ceb&uacute; April
27th, 1565, and immediately began negotiations with the natives.</p>
<p>These, however, remembering their successful resistance to
Magellan&rsquo;s party but a generation before, opposed every advance
of the Spaniards. The latter, notwithstanding, finally took possession
of the town, and sacked it; but for months they were so harassed by the
chief and his subjects that they were several times on the point of
retiring. Legaspi, however, decided to remain, and the natives, growing
accustomed to their presence, gradually yielded to the new order of
things; and thus the first step in the conquest of the islands was
made. The people were declared Spanish subjects. Happy at his success,
Legaspi determined to send the news at once to Spain. Urdaneta was
therefore commissioned to bear the despatches. In due time he arrived
at his destination.</p>
<p>Legaspi, meanwhile, steadily and successfully pursued the conquest
of Ceb&uacute; and surrounding islands. He succeeded most admirably
also in winning the confidence of the natives. Their dethroned King
Tupas was baptized, and his daughter married one of the Spaniards.
Other alliances also were made, which bound the two races together.</p>
<p>The Portuguese, the natural enemies of Spanish exploration and
conquest, now appeared on the scene and attempted, in vain, to dispute
the possession of the successful invaders. The Spaniards then built a
fort, and plots of land were marked out for the building of houses for
the colonists. In 1570 Ceb&uacute; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35"
href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>was declared a city, and
Legaspi, by special grant from the King, received the title of
Governor-General of all the lands that he might be so fortunate as to
conquer.</p>

alt="A Glimpse of the Old Canal." width="699" height="487">
<p class="figureHead">A Glimpse of the Old Canal.</p>
</div>
<p>Soon afterward, Captain Juan Saicedo, Legaspi&rsquo;s grandson, was
sent to the island of Luzon to reconnoiter the territory and to bring
it into subjection to Spain. Martin de Goiti and a few soldiers
accompanied him. They were well received by the various chiefs they
visited. Among these were King Lacandola, the Rajah of Tondo, and his
nephew, the stern young Rajah Soliman, of Manila. Intimidated by the
countenances of the warlike-looking foreigners, and awed by the
mysterious symbols of their priests, these superstitious chiefs agreed
forever, for no consideration, and without reservation, to yield up
their independence, to pay tribute, and to aid in the subjugation of
their own countrymen. A treaty of peace having been made, the Spaniards
acted as if they were the natural owners of the soil. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span></p>
<p>Young Soliman, however, soon found occasion to demonstrate that he,
at least, had no intention of carrying out his part of this enforced
contract. He sowed the seeds of insurrection broadcast among the
various surrounding tribes, and not only carried on an offensive
warfare against the invaders, but set fire to his capital, Manila, that
it might not become the spoil of the invaders. Soliman and his little
army were put to flight by Salcedo, who generously pardoned the young
chief upon his again swearing fealty to the King of Spain. Then, while
Goiti with his forces remained in the vicinity of Manila, Salcedo
pursued his adventurous way as far as the Taal district. All the
country of the Batangas province was also subdued by him. About this
time Salcedo himself, severely wounded by an arrow, returned to
Manila.</p>

alt="In the Batangas Province." width="701" height="499">
<p class="figureHead">In the Batangas Province.</p>
</div>
<p>Legaspi being informed of the occurrences in Luzon, soon joined
Salcedo at Cavit&eacute;, where chief Lacondola gave his submission.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>Legaspi, continuing his journey to Manila, was
there received with much pomp and acclamation. He not only took formal
possession of all the surrounding territory, but also declared Manila
to be the capital of the whole Archipelago. He next publicly proclaimed
the sovereignty of the King of Spain over all the islands.</p>
<p>Speaking of this period, the old chronicler, Gaspar de San Agustin,
says: &ldquo;He (Legaspi) ordered them (the natives) to finish the
building of the fort in construction at the mouth of the river (Pasig),
so that His Majesty&rsquo;s artillery might be mounted therein for the
defense of the port and the town. He also ordered them to build a large
house inside the battlement walls for Legaspi&rsquo;s own residence,
and another large house and church for the priests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides building these two large houses, he told them to
erect 150 dwellings of moderate size for the remainder of the Spaniards
to live in. All this they promptly promised to do; but they did not
obey; for the Spaniards were themselves obliged to complete the work of
the fortifications.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The City Council of Manila was constituted on the 24th June, 1571.
On the 20th of August of the following year Miguel Lopez de Legaspi
died. His was a most eventful, arduous life. His career was honorable,
and he occupied a prominent place in the colonial history of his
country. He was buried in the Augustine chapel of San Fausto in Manila,
where his royal standard and armorial bearings hung until the
occupation of the city by the British in 1763.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Guido de Lavezares succeeded Legaspi as Governor of
the islands, and had not long taken possession when he had to defend
them against the assaults of the celebrated Chinese corsair,
Li-ma-hong.</p>
<p>This redoubtable Celestial had early shown a martial spirit, and
became a member of a band of pirates that for many years <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>infested
the seas. Here he so distinguished himself by his prowess and cruelty
that, upon the death of the leader, he was at once elected chief of the
buccaneers. At length this Celestial Viking essayed an attack on the
Philippines. It is said that he first heard of the remarkable wealth of
the islands from the crew of a Chinese merchantman returning from
Manila. After committing a few depredations along the coast, this
Captain Kidd of the Chinese Main appeared before Manila on the 29th of
November, 1594, with a fleet of 62 armed junks, manned by more than
2,000 sailors. Twenty-five hundred soldiers were also on board for
effective warfare, and more than 2,000 Chinese artisans and women, with
which he intended to found the colony that was to be the capital of his
new Empire.</p>
<p>So secret was the landing of the Chinese, and so sudden was their
attack, that they were already within the gates of the city before the
Spaniards knew that they were at hand.</p>
<p>Martin de Goiti, second in command to the Governor, was the first to
receive their attack; and, after a brave defense, he was killed with
many of his soldiers. The flames from his burning residence gave the
Governor himself his first intimation of the enemy&rsquo;s presence.
Flushed with success, Sioco, the Japanese leader of the buccaneers,
then stormed the Fort of Santiago, where many Spanish soldiers had
taken refuge. A small body of fresh troops coming to the aid of the
besieged, the Chinese, after considerable loss, retreated, fearing that
other reinforcements might follow and cut off their return to the
ships.</p>
<p>It was now reported that Li-ma-hong himself, who, with the greater
part of his force, was at Cavit&eacute;, would lead the next assault.
The inhabitants of Manila, therefore, awaited him in great terror.</p>
<p>Fortunately, however, that intrepid warrior, Juan Salcedo, fresh
from his conquests in the north, now came to the city&rsquo;s aid. Just
about sunrise on the 3d of December the Chinese squadron again appeared
in the bay near the capital. The Celestials disembarked, and, it is
said, their leader, in an eloquent speech, incited his followers to the
assault, with glowing promises of plunder. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span></p>
<p>Meantime, while the Chinese were forming into battle-line, within
the walls of the city the drums and the trumpets of the Spaniards kept
up an inspiring din, and all that were able to bear arms hastened to
the defense. It was an important moment in the history of the
colony,&mdash;an hour big with fate; for the coming battle would decide
for either European or Asiatic domination.</p>
<p>Again Li-ma-hong chose his trusted lieutenant to lead the attack;
and fifteen hundred picked troops, armed to the teeth, followed him,
swearing to take the fort or leave their corpses as a testimonial to
their valor.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e1667width" id="p039"><img src="images/p039.jpg"
alt="In the Province of Pangasinan." width="698" height="425">
<p class="figureHead">In the Province of Pangasinan.</p>
</div>
<p>The city was then set on fire in several places, and in three
divisions the Chinese advanced to the attack, Li-ma-hong himself from
the outside supporting them with a well-directed cannonade against the
walls.</p>
<p>After a spirited assault, Sioco succeeded in entering the fort, and
here a bloody hand-to-hand conflict took place. Again and again the
Spaniards forced their fierce assailants over the walls; again and
again the Chinese poured into the breaches, while the trembling
non-combatants within the city awaited the result in agonized suspense.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span></p>
<p>Salcedo was at the front and everywhere. Time and again, with
indomitable courage, he rallied his men; and splendidly did they
respond to his magnificent leadership. The old Governor himself was at
the front, shouting encouragement; and many prominent citizens also
distinguished themselves by feats of remarkable heroism. The Chinese,
once more, gathering their shattered numbers together, plunged into the
ranks of their enemies, and it was not until after the loss of their
daring leader that the few that remained turned their repulse into a
disorderly flight, and Manila and the Philippines were saved to Spain
and America. Salcedo now eagerly took the offensive and pursued the
panic-stricken fugitives back to their ships, killing great numbers on
the way.</p>
<p>In vain Li-ma-hong tried to regain his advantage. Troop after troop
were sent ashore, only to join the rout and return confused and
disorganized back to the fleet. The Spaniards had conquered.</p>
<p>Li-ma-hong, nevertheless, was determined to found his Empire and to
set up his capital in another part of the islands&mdash;in the province
of Pangasinan. Salcedo was accordingly despatched against him, but was
unable to dislodge him. Hearing, however, that the Chinese Emperor also
was about to send an expedition against him, the wily pirate secretly
departed, leaving his Spanish enemies not at all displeased at being
thus cheaply rid of his presence.</p>
<p>The friars, ever on the lookout for their own interests, attributed
their deliverance to the aid of St. Andrew. He, therefore, was declared
the Patron Saint of Manila&mdash;high mass in his honor being
celebrated at 8 <span class="sc">A. M.</span> in the Cathedral every
30th of November.</p>
<p>The old chroniclers relate that some of the native chiefs took
advantage of the disturbance to foment a rebellion against their
Spanish conquerors; but all other disturbances were speedily
quelled.</p>
<p>Civil disturbances, civil conflicts, now followed in the wake of
these struggles against foreign aggression and domestic insurrection.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>In these internal dissensions, all branches of the
Government took part. It was the Governor-General against the Supreme
Court, the Supreme Court against the Clergy, the Clergy against
All.</p>
<p>The Governor was censured for alleged undue exercise of arbitrary
authority. The Supreme Court, patterned after the one in Mexico, was
also accused of seeking to overstep the limits of its functions. Every
law was reduced to the practise of a quibble, every quibble was
administered with a dilatoriness that was destructive not only to all
legitimate industry, but also to the encouragement and maintenance of
order. To make matters even worse, the clergy, with their pretense of
immunity from all State-control, interfered in all matters that
promised profit. Indeed, there were few things out of which these wily
friars were unable to extract a generous tithe.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Dutch Appear upon the Scene.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Chinese pirate had been taught a severe lesson,
and had departed. The memory of his ravages, however, was still fresh
in the minds of his conquerors when other buccaneers, far mere
formidable and dangerous, appeared in the waters of the Philippines,
threatening the peace and safety of the colonists.</p>
<p>Kindling with a desire for vengeance on their ancient foes the
Spaniards, and flaming with greed for the richly-freighted Spanish
argosies, the Dutch made repeated sallies from their secure retreat in
the Moluccas, spreading terror in their wake. The galleons full of
silver from Mexico, the ships laden with the comforts and luxuries of
far-away Spain, fell a delightful prey into the hands of these
remorseless freebooters, that never gave nor asked quarter. Many were
the conflicts with these ruthless invaders, and many a rich prize did
they tow away from the Philippine waters, while the angry Spaniards on
shore stood transfixed,&mdash;in helpless misery.</p>
<p>Millions of dollars intended for the salaries of the Government
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>officials and the troops, were thus stolen, and
though the colonists were often victorious, yet the enemy, with
characteristic Dutch audacity, refused to be defeated; in fact, he
invariably reappeared with a new demonstration of bloody rapacity.</p>
<p>Upon one occasion a Dutch squadron anchored at the entrance of
Manila Bay. It remained several months, seizing from time to time the
merchantmen on their way to the Manila market. It thus secured an
immense booty; its presence, too, becoming extremely prejudicial to
trade and to the interests of the colony.</p>
<p>Juan de Silva, the Governor, therefore began to prepare an armament
to drive these freebooters from the bay. One night he dreamt that St.
Mark had offered to help him. Awaking, he consulted a priest about his
dream, who interpreted it to be an omen of victory. On St. Mark&rsquo;s
day, accordingly, the Spaniards sallied forth to meet their hereditary
foe; they sailed from Cavit&eacute; with ten ships, carrying twenty
guns. Over 1,000 Europeans and a large number of natives manned this
fleet, the latter being religiously told that the Dutch were infidels,
and, therefore, deserved extermination.</p>
<p>Once more the possession of the colony was to be decided. This time
the conflict was to be between two rival nations from the same
continent,&mdash;between Protestant and Catholic. The clergy, hence,
were keenly alive to its importance: mass was said in all the churches,
bells were tolled, and images of the Patron Saints of the colony were
daily paraded through the streets.</p>
<p>The Governor himself took command, and incited his followers to
martial order by proclaiming St. Mark&rsquo;s promised intercession.
From his ship he unfurled the royal standard,&mdash;on which the image
of the Virgin was conspicuously embroidered,&mdash;to give
encouragement to the eyes of the faithful. He then gave the signal for
the advance, and they swiftly bore down upon the enemy. The Dutch were
quietly awaiting the attack, and the conflict was fierce and
sanguinary. It was a calm, beautiful day; but the calmness soon gave
place to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>thundering turbulence of battle, and the beauty
soon became the ugliness of war.</p>
<p>The contest lasted about six hours, and the Dutch, unable longer to
cope against odds so overwhelming, were finally vanquished; their three
ships were destroyed, and their flags, artillery, and plundered
merchandise to the value of $300,000 were seized.</p>

<p class="figureHead">San Augustine Church, in Old Manila.</p>
</div>
<p>This important struggle is known in the history of the islands as
the battle of Playa Honda. Had it ended otherwise, it is probable that
the Philippines would have been for the Dutch another Java, and a most
interesting problem would not have sought solution at the hands of the
American people.</p>
<p>Several other engagements with the Dutch occurred at different
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>times; first one, then the other side being
victorious. And thus for over a century the contest continued, until by
the Peace of Westphalia, in 1648, Holland&rsquo;s independence was
fully established, her impoverished and weakened foe being forced to a
tardy recognition of what had been an obstinate fact for many
years.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Japanese, and the Martyred Saints.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The struggling colony was menaced by yet another foe.
Early commercial relations had been entered into with the Japanese, who
had established one or two trading-settlements in different parts of
Luzon. It was not long, therefore, before the news of the Spanish
occupation of the Philippines reached the Emperor of Japan.
Accordingly, in 1593, he sent an ultimatum to the Governor-General,
demanding his surrender, and that he acknowledge him as his liege
lord.</p>
<p>The Japanese Ambassador, Farranda Kiemon, was received with great
honor, and treated with all the deference due to a royal envoy: the
colonists were not yet strong enough to manifest a high degree of
independence when threatened by so powerful a foe. So the Governor
prudently resorted to diplomacy. He replied, that, being but a vassal
of the King of Spain, a most powerful and opulent sovereign, he was
prevented from giving homage to any other monarch; that his first duty,
naturally, was to defend the colony against invasion; that he should,
however, be happy to make a Treaty of Commerce with His Majesty, and
would, accordingly, send several envoys to his capital to treat
concerning the same.</p>
<p>This done, it is related, the Spaniards were received in great
state. The treaty was then adjusted to the satisfaction of both
parties.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e1741width" id="p045"><img src="images/p045.jpg"
alt="A Suburb of Old Manila." width="720" height="461">
<p class="figureHead">A Suburb of Old Manila.</p>
</div>
<p>Unfortunately, however, these envoys, returning homeward, were
drowned, and shortly afterward two religious embassies were sent to
Japan to renew the treaty and to convert the benighted inhabitants of
that country to God and the true Church. After <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>thirty
days, sailing they arrived at their destination. The friar Pedro
Bautista, chief of the embassy, was now presented to the Emperor
Taycosama, and the treaty was renewed. The most important feature of
this agreement was the permission to build a chapel at Meaco, near
Osaka. This was opened with ceremonial pomp in 1594.</p>
<p>Now the chief of the Jesuits&mdash;the sect were by royal favor
allowed to follow their calling among the Portuguese traders in
Nagasaki&mdash;bitterly opposed what he deemed the exclusive right of
his order, conceded by Pope Gregory XIII., and confirmed by Imperial
decree.</p>
<p>The Portuguese traders, foreseeing that the arrival of Bautista and
his priests was but a prelude to Spanish domination,&mdash;when they,
naturally, would be the sufferers,&mdash;forewarned the Governor of
Nagasaki.</p>
<p>The Emperor was alarmed; for he now also became convinced that the
Philippine Ambassadors were actuated to missionary zeal by ulterior
motives; and, fearing that the priests, by their doctrines, might
pollute the fountain of his ancient religion,&mdash;thus paving the way
for their domination and his own ultimate ruin,&mdash;he at once
commanded that all attempts to convert the natives must cease.
Bautista, in holy zeal, not heeding the Imperial injunction, was
expelled, and retired to Luzon, leaving several of his embassy behind.
Some of these also, obstinately persisting in violating the Imperial
mandate, were arrested and imprisoned.</p>
<p>Upon his arrival in Manila, Bautista fitted out another expedition,
and soon again landed in Japan with a company of Franciscans.</p>
<p>The indignant Emperor, convinced of the duplicity of the Spaniards,
caused them to be seized and cast into prison. A few natives, who had
forsaken the religion of their forefathers for the discord-breeding
doctrines of the foreigners, were also apprehended.
All&mdash;twenty-six in number&mdash;were then condemned to death.
After their ears and noses had been cut off, they were exhibited in
various towns, as a warning to the other foreigners and to the
populace. Upon the breast of each hung a board, that announced the
sentence of the wearer and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47"
href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>reasons for his punishment. They
were then crucified, and, after lingering for several hours in great
agony, were speared to death.</p>
<p>The colony was much perturbed when the news of the sad fate of the
zealous Franciscans reached Manila. Special masses were said, and
processions of monks daily paraded through the streets.</p>

alt="The Abandoned Acqueduct." width="692" height="543">
<p class="figureHead">The Abandoned Acqueduct.</p>
</div>
<p>The Governor was finally prevailed on to send a deputation to Japan
for the bodies of the executed priests; for the relics of these martyrs
were fraught with too many possibilities of profit to their
co-religionists to be left in a foreign country in ignominious
sepulture. It is related, also, that these envoys were entertained most
royally, and the Emperor gave them a long letter to the Governor,
justifying with many reasons the late execution and his vigorous
policy. It seems, however, that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48"
href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>relics were lost on the homeward
voyage. Notwithstanding, many priests soon ventured to Japan, to court
a martyr&rsquo;s doom and to furnish relics for the adoration of their
superstitious countrymen. Hence, it is not surprising that a great many
other similar executions afterward took place.</p>
<p>Incensed at these frequent and persistent violations of his
well-founded prohibition, the Emperor finally refused to treat with the
embassies sent from the colony; and, as he and his successors continued
to enforce their stern decrees, the transportation of Spanish priests
to Japan was finally prohibited. Had the Japanese been less severe,
less astute, it is highly probable that all the evil consequences that
they foresaw,&mdash;as a result of the Christian
propaganda,&mdash;would really have taken place. As it was, they saved
both their religion and their Empire.</p>

<h3 class="main">General Draper&rsquo;s Expedition.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The affairs of the colony&mdash;now directed by custom
and precedence into the narrow channel of official routine&mdash;flowed
placidly along in undisturbed monotony. But in 1762 another enemy
appeared before the walls of Manila; an enemy more powerful than any
that had heretofore threatened the peace of that tropical capital. War
had been declared by Spain against England, and the enterprising
inhabitants of that little isle were not slow in following their
traditional policy of striking the first blow. Rodney and Monckton were
sent to Havana. This they took without great difficulty, and soon a
British squadron, composed of thirteen ships, under the command of
Admiral Cornish, was despatched to Manila.</p>
<p>It was the evening of the 22nd of September when the English fleet
arrived in the bay, and the following morning Admiral Cornish sent an
officer to the Governor, demanding the surrender of the citadel. At
this peremptory proceeding the haughty Spaniard was highly incensed,
and his refusal was couched in terms no less indignant than
defiant.</p>
<p>Words having signally failed to bring the Spanish to terms, a
demonstration of force was decided upon, and Brigadier-General Draper
was sent on shore with a large body of troops. The garrison, however,
treated this display with counter demonstrations, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>and
Draper&rsquo;s threats with lofty disdain. Draper therefore resolved to
parley no longer, and the bombardment began the next day.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e1796width" id="p050"><img src="images/p050.jpg"
alt="Tower of Defense, Church, and Priest&rsquo;s House." width="696"

<p class="figureHead">Tower of Defense, Church, and Priest&rsquo;s
House.</p>
</div>
<p>The British forces consisted of 1600 European troops, nearly 3000
seamen, and about 800 Sepoys&mdash;about 5000 fighting men. The forces
in Manila, on the other hand, were only 603 Spaniards and 77 small
guns. In the meantime, the ardor of the British had been inflamed by
the capture of a Spanish galleon containing $2,500,000 in specie.</p>
<p>The Archbishop, Manuel Antonio Rojo, who acted also as
Governor,&mdash;the seat of that functionary being vacant at the
time,&mdash;seeing the hopelessness of the conflict, and desiring to
avert unavailing bloodshed, counseled surrender. But the soldiers in
the garrison, under their fiery leader Simon de Anda, were utterly
intractable, and prepared vigorously for the defense. After a few
unsuccessful sorties, the Spanish batteries, on the 24th September,
began a rapid but harmless cannonade. Again a company sallied forth
from the garrison to attack the invaders, but this also was repulsed,
with considerable loss to the Spanish. The English now renewed the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>bombardment, and terrific havoc was made among the
ranks of the enemy. Some two thousand natives, in three columns,
advanced toward the three improvised redoubts held by the British, and
were driven back with great loss and confusion. Panic-stricken, the
natives fled back to their villages, and on the 5th of October the
besieging forces entered the walled city. The bombardment, meanwhile,
continued. Nor did it cease until the forts were demolished and most of
the Spanish artillerymen killed. It is estimated that 20,000
cannon-balls and 5000 shells were thrown into the city.</p>
<p>The military men among the Spanish now counseled surrender. The
civilians, contrariwise, were eager to continue the defense. But as
most of the fortifications were destroyed, and since &ldquo;confusion
worse confounded&rdquo; already reigned in the city, many fled to the
surrounding villages.</p>
<p>The opposing civilians having barricaded and otherwise obstructed
the streets, the British advanced into the heart of the city, clearing
the way before them with a raking fire of musketry.</p>
<p>General Draper now sent Colonel Monson to the Archbishop, demanding
instant and absolute surrender. The Archbishop appeared and offered
himself as a prisoner, also presenting terms of capitulation. These
provided for the free exercise of religion, the security of private
property, unrestricted commerce between the Spaniards and the natives,
and the English support of the Supreme Court in its attempts to
preserve order.</p>

<h3 class="main">The British Demand an Indemnity.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">General Draper readily granted these terms, but
demanded an indemnity of $4,000,000. To this the Spanish agreed, and
these terms were then signed by both parties to the compact.</p>
<p>When the Union Jack was first unfurled from Fort Santiago, it is
said that the British burst forth into a chorus of ringing cheers.</p>
<p>But their joy was not unmixed with sensations of sorrow; for, it is
reported, over 1500 men, and many gallant officers, were lost in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>the assault. The city was then given over to the
mercy of the victorious troops, and a riotous scene of pillage ensued;
many excesses were committed, the Sepoys, in particular, committing
many atrocities. General Draper forthwith gave the command that these
outrages should cease; and guards were at once placed at the doors of
the convents and the nunneries to prevent outrages on the women. A few
thieving Chinamen, who had taken advantage of the confusion to add to
their own profit, were hanged; and the General, it is said, with his
own hand cut down a soldier that he caught stealing after his
inhibition had been proclaimed.</p>

<p class="figureHead">A Native Village in the Foot-hills: Old

</div>
<p>The English now demanded the payment of the stipulated indemnity,
but the enforced contributions from the wealthy inhabitants, with the
silver from the churches&mdash;all that the Spaniards professed to be
able to collect&mdash;amounted to only a little more than half a
million dollars,&mdash;but one-eighth of the stipulated sum.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>Threat and force were alike unavailing to produce
the other monies promised, although the friars, it is believed, had
secreted immense sums, determined at all hazards to preserve their
accumulated store from the rapacity of their Protestant enemy.</p>
<p>By the terms of the capitulation the entire Archipelago had been
surrendered to the British; but Simon de Anda, who commanded the
Spanish forces during the siege, had now established himself in Bulacan
as Provisional Governor, in opposition to the authority of the
Archbishop who had bitterly denounced the surrender. The clergy,
however, were the more influential part of the Colonial Government, and
General Draper accordingly treated with them alone, obtaining their
consent to a cession of all the islands to the King of England. Draper
himself then returned to England, leaving behind a Provisional Military
Government.</p>
<p>Admiral Cornish now demanded the payment of the million dollars that
the British had finally decided to accept as full indemnity.</p>
<p>The Spaniard, however, continued to plead poverty, and the money was
not forthcoming. Several thousands of dollars were eventually unearthed
in the convent where the friars had hidden it. The British, though
convinced of the deception that these holy brethren had practised to
save these dollars,&mdash;wrung from the hearts of the
poor,&mdash;were, however, unable to lay their hands upon the
treasure.</p>
<p>Simon de Anda, the self-constituted Governor, now became unusually
active in the provinces, and several expeditions were sent out to quell
the various insurrections that he had been stirring up. One of these,
numbering 600 men, under the leadership of Captain Eslay, in the
province of Bulacan, assaulted and took a fortified convent. They were
also victorious in some engagements with a body of natives, several
thousand strong, under the command of Lieutenant Bustos, a Spanish
officer. As several Austin friars had been found among the slain, the
British rightly believed that their order had been conspiring against
them. Many, therefore, were arrested. Eleven were sent back to Europe.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span></p>
<p>Naturally suspicious of all the friars, the English now entered the
Augustine convent and found that these priests had been no less
deceitful than their brethren in the other orders. Six thousand, five
hundred dollars in coin were found hidden in the garden, and large
quantities of wrought silver elsewhere. The convent itself was then
searched and all the valuables found therein taken.</p>

<p class="figureHead">A Bamboo House in Pampanga Province.</p>
</div>
<p>About this time the Spaniards professed to have discovered a
conspiracy among the Chinese in the province of Pampanga, the object
being, they said, to murder Anda and his Spanish followers. The Chinese
had raised extensive fortifications, saying that these preparations
were all made as a defense against an expected attack from the
British.</p>
<p>The Spaniards, however, suspecting sympathy with their enemies,
attacked the Celestials and a general massacre of the Chinese followed.
Many thousands, too, were killed that had taken no part in the war.</p>
<p>Admiral Cornish, disgusted and infuriated with their obvious
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>deception and palpable dilly-dallying, again
demanded the payment of the indemnity. But he was forced to content
himself with a bill on the Madrid Treasury.</p>
<p>Anda now appointed Bustos Alcalde of Bulacan: he hoped great things
of his seditious and unscrupulous lieutenant; he knew that he would
resort to every means to harass the enemy: he therefore, accordingly,
ordered him to recruit and train troops.</p>
<p>For Anda still cherished the hope of confining the British, perhaps,
even, of driving them from the colony. So, with practiced subtlety and
with masked deviltry, he set about accomplishing his grim purpose.</p>

<p class="first">The British were now kept busy suppressing the
numerous intrigues against their power that sprang up among the Spanish
residents everywhere. Many sorties also were made to dislodge the
persistent and irrepressible Anda and his lieutenant Bustos, now
encamped at Malinta, a village a few miles from Manila. Most of those
assaults, however, proved indecisive and ineffectual. The priests
proved troublesome, and were the cause of much bloodshed, teaching the
natives that the British were infidels.</p>
<p>The Augustine friars were especially hostile, many laying aside the
cowl for the helmet. At Masilo, indeed, the British were defeated by an
Austin friar, who, with a small band of natives, attacked them from
ambush.</p>
<p>The Austin friars, however, had some cause for grievance. For,
according to a recent historian, they had lost nearly a quarter of a
million dollars, fifteen of their convents were destroyed, several
valuable estates despoiled, ten of the members killed in the battle,
and nineteen were taken prisoners and sent as exiles to India and
Europe.</p>
<p>On the 23d of July, 1763, an English vessel brought news of an
armistice between the conflicting Powers. And in the latter part of
August the British Commander received notice <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>of the
articles of peace, by which Manila was to be evacuated (Peace of Paris,
10th of Feb., 1763).</p>
<p>It was several months, however, before peace was finally established
in the island, fierce quarrels having arisen among the rival factions
of the Spaniards as to who should be Governor and receive the city
officially from the British. The Archbishop having died, Anda, who was
in actual command of the troops, was fully recognized by the British as
Governor. Don Francisco de La Torre arriving at this time from Spain
with a commission as Governor-General, Anda resigned the Government to
him on the 17th of March, 1764. Several serious quarrels now took
place, due to jealousy among the English officers; but Anda, on behalf
of the new Governor, formally received the city from the British, who
embarked for India, after having met all claims that could be justly
established against them.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Encomiendoros and the Alcaldes.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the early days of the colony there were, besides
the Governor-General, the sub-governors, known as Encomiendoros, who
rented their provinces at so much per annum, called Encomiendas, from
the General Government. These Encomiendoros were usually men of wealth,
that entered into politics as a speculation. More properly, I should
say, as a peculation; for it became their policy to fleece the natives
and to extort as much money as possible during the term of their
incumbency. Few, indeed, left the scene of their civil brigandage
without full coffers; and as enormous fortunes were to be made during a
few years sojourn in the islands, no wonder that this office was
eagerly sought after in Spain.</p>
<p>This imitation of the methods of the Roman tax-payers, however,
became so demoralizing to the <i>morale</i> of the Spaniards
themselves, and so ruinous to the colony and to the natives, that a
more equitable policy was introduced. The Encomiendoros were succeeded
by Judicial Governors, called Alcaldes, to whom was paid a small
salary, from $300 upward a year, according to the prominence of the
province.</p>
<p>This office, however, proved almost equally remunerative to the
holders; for, by means of a Government license to trade, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>they
were able to create, to their own advantage, monopolies in every line
of industry, thus freezing out all competitors. <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1899" title="Source: Through">Though</span> each was responsible
to the Central Government for the taxes of his provinces, yet this did
not prevent the shrewd and unprincipled from finding profit here also.
For, by a system of false weights and measures, the native, who, in
lieu of silver, brought his produce in payment for taxes, was
shamefully defrauded, the Alcalde sending the indebted amount to the
Government storehouse and selling the rest to his own profit. In
addition, many of these Alcaldes, by arbitrary decrees and despotic
methods, conducted a system of public robbery that in a few years
enriched them at the expense of the long-suffering natives; for them
there was no redress, inasmuch as each Alcalde was also the head of the
Legal Tribunal in his own province. These abuses, however, became so
flagrant that the Alcaldes were finally forbidden to trade; but as this
measure was not as effectual as had been expected, sweeping reforms
were instituted.</p>
<p>To recount what these were; to mention in detail what malignant
opposition was manifested by a large body of natives and resident
Spaniards toward the purposed overthrow of the old system, would be
only to reiterate well-known characteristics and abnormalities of the
Spanish nature; placed, too, in but a slightly different setting.</p>
<p>I will merely add that these Alcaldes, these perpetrators and
beneficiaries of wholesale misrule and dishonor, yielded finally to the
reform-wave, and, accordingly, fell away before their own judicial
perversion. And the new system, it must be confessed, is a great
improvement upon the old.</p>
<p>But the evil wrought upon the Filipino mind and character was
deep-planted. For, by the despotic and summary disposing of his labor
and chattels, in the name of the King,&mdash;abetted frequently, too,
by seemingly supernatural means,&mdash;respect for the Spaniard and the
white man in general had fled, fear and distrust supplanting it.</p>

</div>
<p>In the new order of things,&mdash;instituted by a decree from the
Queen-Regent Maria Cristina, the 26th of February, 1886,&mdash;18 Civil
Governorships were created, and the Alcaldes&rsquo; functions were
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>confined to their Judgeships. And thus the former
frightful distortion of justice was overcome and banished.</p>
<p>So, too, under this law of 1886 each Civil Governor has a Secretary,
who serves as a check upon his chief, if he be illegally inclined.</p>
<p>Accordingly, two new official safeguards were thus erected in the
fabric of Colonial Administration in these 18 different provinces.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Present Division and Administration.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The colony was then divided into 19 civil provinces,
including Sulu, and into 3 grand military divisions.</p>
<p>As before, at the head was the Governor-General,&mdash;the
supervising and executive officer of the province,&mdash;directly
responsible to Spain. His salary is $40,000 a year. He is assisted by
an Executive Cabinet and by an Administrative Council. The Provincial
Governor, the successor to the Alcalde, must be a Spaniard, and at
least 30 years old. He is the direct representative of the
Governor-General and it is his duty to execute his decrees and to
maintain order. He also has the power of appointment and removal,
presides over provincial elections, controls the civil and local guard,
interprets the laws,&mdash;usually to suit his own profit or
convenience,&mdash;supervises the balloting for military conscription,
can assess fines to the amount of $50, or imprison for 30 days, is
Superintendent of Public Instruction, issues licenses and collects
taxes. It is his duty also to furnish statistics and to control the
Postal and Telegraph service. He is the Superintendent of health,
prisons, charities, agriculture, forestry, and of manufactures. It will
thus be seen that his duties are as diverse as they are important. He
is now allowed no percentage, nor other emolument than his salary. At
the same time, a shrewd Governor is yet able to reap a golden harvest.
This, however, can be done only in conjunction with other Government
officers.</p>
<p>Owing to the extreme shortness of his term of office&mdash;three
years only&mdash;there is no incentive for the improvement of his
province, as his successors would reap the results as well as the
credit of his industry. Besides, he has no reason to hope that a good
work begun will be a good work continued; for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>the next
Governor may be averse to exertion, or may be at variance with his
policy.</p>

"images/p061.jpg" alt="Children of a Gobernadorcillo." width="344"
height="515">
<p class="figureHead">Children of a Gobernadorcillo.</p>
</div>
<p>Most of the Governors live in good style; as a rule they spend about
two hours a day in Government employ. Is it to be wondered at, then,
that this office is so eagerly sought after in Spain?</p>
<p>There are about 750 towns in the colony; each governed by a
Gobernadorcillo, &ldquo;Little Governor,&rdquo; called Capitan; usually
a native or half-caste. This office is elected every two years, and is
to the Provincial Governor what the latter is to the Governor-General.
He is the tax-collector of his district, and is, furthermore,
responsible for the amount apportioned to his district. If he fails to
collect this, he must make the deficit good out of his own pocket.
Under him are a number of deputies, called Cabezas, each likewise
responsible for another division of the population called a
Barangay,&mdash;a collection of forty or fifty families. If the
individuals of this group are unable to pay, the property is distrained
and sold by the deputy, who would otherwise have to make good the
amount himself. If the proceeds of the sale fail to equal the
indebtedness of the delinquent, he is cast into prison.</p>
<p>I have often seen respectable men deported to the penal settlements;
and for no other offense than inability to pay the oppressive tax laid
upon their shoulders, regardless of the season,&mdash;whether
productive or not. Their families, meanwhile, left without a head, were
thrown into the most woeful destitution. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Gobernadorcillo gets the munificent salary of $200 a year,
though his expenses, for clerk-hire, for presents to his chief, and for
entertainments in his honor, are often many times greater. A shrewd
Gobernadorcillo, however, manages to make something out of the place,
which, in some districts, is eagerly sought after by rich planters. The
official dress of this worthy is a short black jacket, the tail worn
over the trousers. He also carries a stick as a sign of authority. To
him is entrusted the apprehension of criminals, and he has command of
the local guards, or cuadrilleros, the police of the towns.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Taxes and What Became of Them.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It can easily be guessed that the taxes are not
inconsiderable, when I simply mention a few things that are assessed:
There is a tax on the ownership and sale of live-stock and vehicles, on
realty, and on all private industries and manufactures. Opium, liquors,
stamps, tobacco, and lotteries yield an immense revenue. Then there is
a Community-fund, which is usually several hundred thousand dollars a
year in each province, and is supposed to be spent in the interest of
the community. The Chinese Capitation tax also brings in a large
amount. But the most common and onerous tax of all is that arising from
the Government sale of C&eacute;dulas, or documents of identity, which
is a poll-tax from $25 down. The individual paying less than $3.50 is
subject to 15 days&rsquo; hard labor each year and to a fine of 50
cents for each day that he shall fail to work. Those whose
c&eacute;dulas have cost more than $3.50 must also pay a municipal tax
of $1.50. The c&eacute;dula is also used as a passport, and must be
brought into court to render legal instruments effective.</p>

width="720" height="458">
<p class="figureHead">Along the Escolta; Principal Business Street in
New Manila.</p>
</div>
<p>From this brief and imperfect survey of the system of provincial
taxation, it can easily be gathered that the revenues are considerable;
and yet, of the hundreds of thousands of dollars extorted from the
natives in each province, under the plausible <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>pretexts
of an avaricious policy, it is safe to say that not a dollar is
expended for any local improvements. No building of bridges, no
constructing of highways, no public schools, nor halls of justice must
mar the stagnant serenity of provincial life. Nothing is ever repaired;
a system of &ldquo;let alone&rdquo; blights every aspiration, and is
fatal to the extension of commerce and industry. Consequently, in the
wet season, for vehicles, the public roads are impassable, and, in many
parts of the country, for months transportation is practically at a
stand-still. As if effectually to close every door to progress, private
individuals, too, are forbidden by law to repair the highways.</p>
<p>Did any government ever foster a more imbecile and iniquitous policy
for its own damnation?</p>
<p>Although the speculations in the colony are not so enormous as
formerly, yet there is no doubt that they still amount to several
millions annually; mostly, however, at the seat of Government in
Manila. It is indeed notorious that General Weyler, during his brief
incumbency of the office, succeeded in placing several millions of
dollars to his credit&mdash;I should have said to his dishonor!</p>

<h3 class="main">Dilatory and Abortive Courts.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Perhaps no feature of Colonial life is fraught with
more evil and is so disgusting, as the process of the courts. The
Supreme Court of the early years of the colony was modeled after the
one in Majorca, and on several occasions when the Governorship has been
left vacant, it has assumed the functions of the
executive&mdash;pro-tem.</p>
<p>There are two Supreme Law Courts in the colony: one in Manila; the
other in Ceb&uacute;. The President of the one in Manila has a salary
of $7,000 a year; that of Ceb&uacute;, $6,000. There are also 41
Superior Courts, of various degrees of importance, the salary of the
judges ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 per annum. The department of
Justice alone costs the colony about $350,000 a year. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span></p>
<p>The dilatoriness of the courts has become proverbial. It is, in
fact, years before a case can be brought to a close. Meantime, the
litigant has been fleeced out of an amount perhaps a hundred times the
value of the article under litigation. The islands are full of native
pettifoggers from the law schools of Manila, who have learned too well
the meaning of the Spanish <i>ma&ntilde;ana</i>. A suit can never be
considered as disposed of; for another judge, scenting the faint
possibility of a fee, may again have it retried. Thus I have seen the
lives of acquitted persons again brought into jeopardy by the
meddlesome officiousness and the grasping greed of a new judge. He that
goes to court in the Philippines must not do so without reckoning the
cost.</p>

<h3 class="main">A New Yorker&rsquo;s Experience.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following experience of an American friend of
mine, whom I knew very well in Manila, will bring out in a graphic way
the course of justice in the Philippines. Nor is his experience
uncommon. It is, in fact, the usual one of the stranger or the native
who goes to the fountain of Justice for the redress of a grievance.</p>
<p>I quote part of his letter written to a common friend:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first"><i>In 1871 I joined Mr. William Morton Clark of
Philadelphia, who had a large timber business on the island of Luzon,
and started cutting some timber contracted for by the Chinese
government.</i></p>
<p><i>I soon discovered that I was interfering with the business of a
certain priest, who was also in the same line of business.</i></p>
<p><i>Shortly before this, this priest and an inspector of roads had
loaded the Spanish bark Santa Lucia for Hong-Kong, and had made things
so disagreeable for others who had tried to ship merchandise that
foreigners were becoming afraid to risk their capital.</i></p>
<p><i>Mr. Clark finding how things were going on soon abandoned the
enterprise, and I then determined to fight the thing out on my own
account.</i></p>
<p><i>At this time I had 25,000 cubic feet of hard timber, cut and
squared, for a foreign market, eighty-two buffaloes for hauling, and a
plant of machinery and appliances valued at $7,000.</i></p>
<p><i>I had a license for carrying on my business, duly granted by the
superior government, and in 1874 chartered a vessel at Manila to carry
my timber to Hong-Kong, and then went to the port of Love, where my
timber was, taking with me $940 in gold to prepare for the
vessel&rsquo;s arrival and to continue cutting.</i> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Upon arriving at Love I found that during my absence at Manila a
portion of my timber had been forcibly taken possession of and had been
shipped on board the Spanish bark Teresa by Joaquin Barcello, the
captain of the Teresa, who was then on his way to Hong-Kong. I also
learned that my buffaloes, stock and rice had been removed, and that
Juan Gaal, my foreman, whom I had left in charge of my property, was
all subject to the orders of this Barcello, and that my choppers had
been bribed into the service of Padre Fidel Moreno, the priest of the
town.</i></p>
<p><i>When I complained of this I was confronted with a document signed
by the Adelantado of Love, to the effect that no notice should be taken
of my complaints, to give no testimony in my behalf (thereby shutting
me out of my legal rights), and that my foreman, Juan Gaal, should look
after the interests of Captain Barcello until the captain&rsquo;s
return from China.</i></p>
<p><i>I then applied to the Governor, protesting against the robbery of
my timber and the appropriation of my property by Captain Barcello and
Juan Gaal, but was merely told that the commandante had so ordered and
that there would be no interference.</i></p>
<p><i>Seeing there was no justice to be had at home, I sought to regain
my rights at Manila and so left the next morning for Manila on the bark
Industria, taking with me all my private papers, contracts,
&amp;c.</i></p>
<p><i>That night we encountered a terrible typhoon in which the vessel
was wrecked, and all that I was able to save was the clothes I then
wore.</i></p>
<p><i>Upon my arrival at Manila I put in a complaint against Captain
Barcello, and also against Padre Moreno and the commandante of the
district, as accomplices in the above fraud and robbery.</i></p>
<p><i>The case dragged along, as is customary in Spanish countries, and
about a year later my funds were all exhausted. At this time a Spanish
friend at Manila, acquainted with my misfortunes, took me to his home
and lent me some money, shortly afterwards sailing for Europe.</i>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>With this money I returned to Love, expecting to find at least a
portion of my timber left which I intended to ship. Upon arriving at
Love I found that Captain Barcello had been there before me and had
seized and shipped everything but a few worm-eaten logs. Barcello had
even hauled the timber I had cut in the mountains, and aided by his
accomplices had cleaned me out entirely during my absence.</i></p>

alt="In the Lumber District." width="702" height="612">
<p class="figureHead">In the Lumber District.</p>
</div>
<p><i>I saw it was no use to complain further, and so I set to work to
cut some more timber, and after much trouble and expense got two
cargoes ready and left for Manila, intending to go from there to
Hong-Kong to sell what I had last cut.</i></p>
<p><i>Learning that Barcello was in Manila and was about to leave
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>for Hong-Kong, I applied to the Alcalde,
Se&ntilde;or Torranco, who had my suit in charge, to stop Barcello from
leaving the country, as my case against him had not yet been
decided.</i></p>
<p><i>This didn&rsquo;t benefit me much, as the Alcalde wouldn&rsquo;t
grant my request, and although a case of robbery and fraud was pending
against him, Barcello was allowed to leave without hindrance.</i></p>
<p><i>I then applied for my passport, but to my surprise this was
refused me, on the ground that my suit should first be decided.</i></p>
<p><i>I then returned to Love, having authorized Charles Germain to
charter for me, and in due time I had despatched three cargoes to
Hong-Kong, but finding that my presence in Hong-Kong would be
absolutely necessary for the success of my business I applied a second
time for my passport, and was again refused.</i></p>
<p><i>Thinking that if I offered security I would be allowed to leave
the town, I named a friend who was willing to go on my bond, but the
Alcalde shut me off from this chance by sending his clerk to my
friend&rsquo;s house, and succeeded in so frightening him that my
friend withdrew his name as my bondsman.</i></p>
<p><i>I know that this act was done deliberately, as at this time, and
during the whole of my suit, the Alcalde was on the most intimate terms
with Captain Barcello.</i></p>
<p><i>My next step was to protest against Se&ntilde;or Torranco trying
or hearing my case, as I showed conclusively that he was hand and glove
with Barcello. This had the desired effect, and the case was
transferred to another Alcalde. Torranco had, however, served his
friend well: he had stopped my passport at a vital point in my business
on a frivolous pretext.</i></p>
<p><i>I was a foreigner, and that was enough, and not being able to
obtain permission to leave the country, all my efforts being frustrated
by those in power, although I was the aggrieved and injured party, I
was held a captive in Manila, my business, meantime, going to ruin
abroad.</i></p>
<p><i>This state of affairs continued for months, with no signs of any
beneficial change in my circumstances, and so I finally brought the
matter officially before the American Consul, who wrote to the
Captain-General, stating my case in full, and advised me to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>abandon my suit, which I did, the Consul
officially notifying the Captain-General of the fact.</i></p>
<p><i>From that day to this I have been sustained by my friends. My
means were exhausted, and I was compelled to leave the hotel a beggar
on the streets, with my resources all gone and heavy debts pressing
upon me.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Mr. Collins was never able to get justice, though he tried
frequently. His experience is no uncommon one. The establishment of a
pure judiciary and the purification of the courts should be one of the
first reforms undertaken by the Americans.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The hierarchy of the colony consists of an Archbishop,
resident in Manila, and four bishops. The Archbishop lives in a Palace,
and has a salary of $12,000 a year, while the annual expenses of the
Cathedral in Manila are not less than $60,000. It was not till several
years after the founding of Manila, in 1578, that the first bishop was
consecrated and a Cathedral was built. Not long afterward, the Manila
See was raised to an Archbishopric.</p>
<p>The present hierarchy costs the Government about $800,000 a year.
The salaries of the priests range from $500 to $2500 per annum; but, in
addition, they derive a large income from the sale of masses,
indulgences, marriage, burial and baptismal-fees, and from the various
commissions incident to their calling. They receive all, and give
nothing.</p>
<p>The several orders have immense revenues from investments in the
islands and in Hong-Kong. They possess magnificent estates; but,
notwithstanding their enormous wealth, they are hard task-masters,
grinding the poor to the paying of the last penny. Their injustice and
tyranny have of late aroused bitter complaint, and are a chief cause of
the late insurrection.</p>

<p>And yet the picture has its lights as well as its shadows. The
friars have, also, in many places, the confidence of the natives,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>and, on the whole, surely influence them for the
repression of their vicious and brutal instincts. A half-barbarous
people can be led only by superstition, and a semi-sacerdotal
government is most effective among an ignorant people.</p>
<p>The friar is usually from a lowly family, and is, therefore, able at
once to enter into sympathy with the humble life of the people. He is
doctor, architect, engineer, and adviser; in all things truly the
father of the community, the representative of the white race and of
social order. Such is the ideal village-curate, and many
such&mdash;good men and true&mdash;are to be found. There, are,
however, many black sheep among them. And the gross immorality of those
that should be examples in virtue, has been a great impediment to the
work of the Church among the thinking natives. There are, also, some
Chinese and native friars; but, owing to the various insurrections, in
which some of these were involved, they are no longer trusted; in fact,
a native can no longer become a priest.</p>
<p>So great is the paternal influence of the priests, that I have often
seen delinquent parishioners flogged for non-attendance at mass.</p>
<p>The Chinese often adopt Christianity for social or business reasons,
or that they may marry the daughter of a native.</p>
<p>All over the islands are shrines to which the people make long
pilgrimages; such pilgrimages, however, partaking more of the character
of feasts than of fasts. The self-denial and the self-imposed hardships
of the European devotee have never found fruitful soil in the native
character. He is never so glad as when a holy-day furnishes him with a
pretext for an elaborate feast, and, in truth, the feast-days alone
relieve the gloom of his monotonous life. Two of the most famous
shrines are the Holy Child of Ceb&uacute; and the Virgin of
Antipolo,&mdash;thousands visiting them yearly.</p>

<p>The Archbishops&mdash;with an exaggerated idea of their own
importance&mdash;soon became exceedingly troublesome to the Civil
Power, by reason of their excessive claims. This was never more
manifest than in their pretended immunity from all State-control. Upon
one occasion the Governor demanded of the Archbishop to produce several
persons charged with capital and other crimes, who had found asylum in
a convent. The Archbishop promptly refused, claiming the prerogative of
Sanctuary. The accused not only openly defied the Governor, but armed
themselves, intending to resist, should he endeavor to apprehend them.
The Governor, learning this, arrested the Archbishop, and confined him
and the priests that had been his abettors in prison, charging them
with conspiracy against the Government.</p>
<p>The news spread over the province with incredible swiftness, and
hundreds of priests, collecting hordes of natives on the way, marched
with riotous demonstrations and violent clamor to the Palace.
Franciscans, Dominicans, and Augustinians forgot their fierce rivalry
and joined together in the shout, &ldquo;Long live the church!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Long live King Philip V!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mob burst open the doors of the Palace, and, the terror-stricken
guards having fled, they forced their way to the Governor, who calmly
awaited them, standing with a loaded musket in his hand. He then
ordered the rabble to retreat, but with wild shrieks, incited by the
priests that accompanied them, they rushed on him. The Governor pulled
the trigger, but his flint failing to strike fire he defended himself
with his bayonet. He was finally surrounded; and insulted, beaten, and
stabbed, he was dragged to jail.</p>
<p>The son of the Governor, running to his father&rsquo;s aid, was
severely wounded by the rebels. Attempting, nevertheless, to cut his
way through, he was killed, and his body horribly mutilated.</p>
<p>The mob then broke open the door of the fortress where the
Archbishop was confined, and liberated him. This worthy was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>then escorted with much acclamation to the Palace,
and assumed charge of the Government, which he held for four years.</p>
<p>This is only one of many exciting conflicts between these two
factions, sometimes one, sometimes the other, being victorious. On four
different occasions the Governorship of the colony was vested in the
Archbishop.</p>
<p>Every Governor-General that has attempted to introduce a liberal
policy has been recalled; for the friars&rsquo; combined influence is
all-powerful. Not even the Archbishop has been able to prevail over the
corporation of the friars; and if he would retain his see, he must not
oppose their traditional prerogatives, nor work for that reform that
would mean the decline of the orders. Indeed, only a few years ago, one
Archbishop, who had made several ineffectual attempts to correct the
abuses in the orders, was one morning <i>found dead in his bed</i>. His
successors have taken good care to profit by his example.</p>

<h3 class="main">Clashings among the Friars.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Interesting is the story of the bitter rivalries
between the different orders, who, though of one religion, were
extremely jealous of one another, showing little of that charity and
forbearance that Christianity, above all, is supposed to inculcate.</p>

<p class="figureHead">A Parish Priest.</p>
</div>
<p>On account of several clashes with the civil power, a priest had
early been sent to Spain by the Church party to gain redress of
grievances. Chief of these was their inability to guide the entire
affairs of the colony into a narrow ecclesiastical groove. The result
was, the introduction of new laws so favorable to the clergy, that,
within three or four years, the colony swarmed with mendicant friars,
whose habits, say the old chroniclers, placed the Spaniards and their
vaunted religion in a most ridiculous light before the natives.</p>
<p>As most of these monks belonged to a different order from the
bishop, who was an Augustinian, and as they often boldly defied his
authority, he became greatly alarmed at their expanding <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>power.
But, after a fierce struggle, he succeeded in so curtailing their
privileges that he still retained his pre-eminence in the colony.</p>
<p>Urdaneta and his Austin friars were the pioneers in the islands, and
following them came a horde of Dominicans and Franciscans, and the
Recoletos, or bare-foot monks. As the saving of souls was the chief
policy of Philip II., the co-operation of the friars was eagerly
welcomed by the early Colonial Government, and it must be admitted that
without their influence the lot of the natives would have been a far
harder one. For the substitution of the rites of paganism for those of
Christianity, even in so crude a form as taught by the friars, was, in
the main, beneficial. Religion&mdash;though not of a very exalted
kind&mdash;was put on an ethical basis, and the self-denial, obedience,
and sacrifice that formed the foundation of the new doctrine, somewhat
reconciled the conquered races to the loss of their primal freedom.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Monks Opposed to Reform.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These orders, presenting the united front of a
corporation, were extremely powerful, and practically unassailable.
When arrayed against an individual, it always resulted in his
defeat,&mdash;that is, his expulsion or imprisonment. They practically
had their way in all things and under all circumstances. Nothing could
withstand <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>them; for, to attack one friar was to attack his
whole order. Thus, much injustice was occasioned. I have known a highly
respectable man, possessed of great wealth, cheated out of house and
home&mdash;yes, his very liberty&mdash;through the intrigues of a friar
that desired to enrich his order. Such societies are a cancer in the
body politic,&mdash;a constant enemy to good government, a menace to
justice, and a foe to liberty.</p>
<p>In the future history of the islands, this will be found one of the
hardest problems to solve. The easiest and most effective plan, it
seems to me, is to cut the Gordian knot&mdash;that is, to expel the
whole body of friars from the islands. By so doing, much shedding of
blood will be saved. For I do not believe that these good brethren will
soon cease to foment insurrection against the hated Protestant
conqueror. They have ever been breeders of mischief under the congenial
rule of Catholic Spain: what won&rsquo;t they do under the
r&eacute;gime of enlightened America, whose first thought is the
liberty that means death to extortion and oppression&mdash;the cardinal
principles of their order. By this, I do not mean a propaganda against
the Catholic Church; for I am a Catholic myself, and firmly believe
that this religion is far better suited to the character of our people
than any form of Protestantism. But the appointment of secular Spanish
or American priests to the parishes would do away with the evils of the
other system, without doing violence either to the Church or to the
conscience of the natives.</p>
<p>The monks have opposed every attempt at reform. Their policy has
ever been the policy of ignorance, knowing that their livelihood
depended upon its perpetuation. It has been their aim chiefly to limit
public instruction to the mere rudiments of knowledge&mdash;giving to
every subject a religious bias. Even the colleges and the University of
Manila are not free from their narrow supervision; while they have ever
maintained a rigid censorship over the press.</p>
<p>The natives, however, are gradually breaking through the network of
superstition that centuries of priestcraft have woven round them. That
they are open to conviction,&mdash;to the light of reason and the hope
of truth,&mdash;deeds bear witness. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79"
href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span></p>
<p>None but the most enlightened natives, of course, recognize, as yet,
their spiritual wants or desire a higher moral state, but many of them,
privately, attest their waning belief in the Church monopoly of all
things temporal in their lives.</p>
<p>Still, owing to the reasons previously stated, those that thus
impugn and combat ecclesiastical preponderance, do so rarely except by
secret word or in a limited conclave.</p>
<p>But the enlightening and invigorating effects incidental to American
occupation will inevitably loose their tongues and rally recruits to
their new standard of thought.</p>
<p>Of this I hope and expect great results.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Character of the Natives.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To judge of the character of one&rsquo;s own people is
extremely difficult. One is likely to be either too severe or too
complimentary. However, I believe, that&mdash;after a residence of many
years in England and on the Continent, and a subsequent stay of eleven
years in America, with frequent visits to the Philippines&mdash;I am
able to judge in the abstract, and, in fact, comparatively to look upon
my own countrymen with the eye of a thorough cosmopolitan.</p>
<p>The natives of the islands are a branch of the Malay race, and may
be divided into three large groups,&mdash;the Tagalogs, the Visayos,
and the Sulus,&mdash;each group subject to modifications and
exceptions. The Tagalogs inhabit Luzon, the northern islands of the
Archipelago, and it is with these that we have mainly to deal, as they
are by far the most numerous and the most intelligent part of the
population, forming, as they do, also the majority of the inhabitants
in Manila and in the largest ports.</p>
<p>The first thing that in the native character impresses the traveler
is his impassive demeanor and imperturbable bearing. He is a born
stoic, a fatalist by nature. This accounts for his coolness in moments
of danger, and his intrepid daring against overwhelming odds. This
feature of the Malay character has often been displayed in the
conflicts of the race with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81"
href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>Europeans in the East Indies.
Under competent leadership the native, though strongly averse to
discipline, can be made a splendid soldier. As sailors, too, I do not
believe they can be equalled. For, lithe, active, and fond of the
water, the Malays have ever shown their inclination for the sea. Their
pirates, coursing in their prahus, have, till a few years ago, for
centuries infested the bays and inlets of the eastern Archipelagos,
looting the towns and villages on shore and taking as booty such
foreign merchantmen as they were able to overcome. On account of the
ravages of these fierce eastern Vikings, Europeans have come to regard
the whole Malay race as cruel and bloodthirsty. But these were pirates
in their own waters, and preyed upon their own countrymen, by whom they
were feared no less than were the Spanish and English freebooters of
old by their countrymen. Why, then, should their outrages and rapacity
be taken as indicative of the Malay character any more than are the
atrocities of the Caucasian corsair of their race?</p>

alt="Negritos of Pampanga." width="481" height="645">
<p class="figureHead">Negritos of Pampanga.</p>
</div>
<p>The natives are all excellent swimmers, and are absolutely
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>fearless in the water. I have seen groups of boys
diving thirty or forty feet for pennies, dropped into the sea by
foreign officers on ships anchored in the bay. Many swim miles with the
greatest ease; and it is no uncommon sight in the outlying districts to
see groups of naked men plunging with drawn dagger among a shoal of
sharks, with whom they fight with a fierceness that always results in
the victory of the native.</p>
<p>Along the beach at Manila, on a summer evening, at the close of the
day&rsquo;s labor, hundreds of hands from the various tobacco
factories&mdash;men, women, and children, of all ages and sizes,
married and unmarried&mdash;may be seen disporting themselves, with
peals of laughter and squeals of delight, in the cool surf.</p>

<p class="figureHead">The Igorrotes.</p>
</div>
<p>As a result of the stoicism of the native character, he never
bewails a misfortune, and has no fear of death. When anything happens
he merely says, It is fate, and calmly goes about his business as if
nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Europeans often seem to notice in them what they deem a lack of
sympathy for the misfortunes of others; but it is not this so much as
resignation to the inevitable. This, it must be confessed, saves them
many a bitter pang. The educated native, however, impregnated with the
bitter philosophy of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href=
"#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>civilized world, is by no means so
imperturbable. While more keenly alive to the sufferings of others, he
is also more sensitive to his own sorrows. After all, whether he is any
happier for his wisdom, is a question.</p>
<p>Incomprehensible inconsistencies obtain in nearly every native.
Students of character may, therefore, study the Filipinos for years,
and yet, at last, have no definite impression of their mental or moral
status. Of course those living in the cities are less baffling to the
physiognomist and the ethnologist; for endemic peculiarities have been
rubbed off or so modified, that the racial traits are not obvious.</p>
<p>But observe the natives in the wilds, in their primitive abodes,
where civilizing forces have not penetrated! You will then be amazed at
the extraordinary mingling and clashing of antithetical characteristics
in one and the same person; uncertain as to when the good or the bad
may be manifested. Like the wind, the mood comes and goes,&mdash;and no
one can tell why.</p>
<p>I myself, with all the inherited feelings, tastes, and tendencies of
my countrymen,&mdash;modified and transmuted, happily,&mdash;have stood
aghast or amused at some hitherto unknown characteristic suddenly
manifesting itself in an intimate acquaintance; and after I had been
for years, too, wholly ignorant of his being so possessed or obsessed.
And after that, the same mental or moral squint would be displayed at
irregular intervals.</p>
<p>It is said by some that the native is shiftless and improvident.</p>
<p>It is true that he is not noted for foresight and energy, as are the
peoples of the temperate zones; but his indolence is the result of
generations of tropical ancestors. Even the most energetic Europeans
yield, in a few years, to the enervating effects of the climate, and
are unable to shake off the lassitude bred by the heat. Besides,
deprived by the Spaniards from all active participation in affairs of
the Government, and robbed of the fruits of industry, all incentive to
advancement and progress was taken away. He, therefore, yields with
composure to the crushing conditions of his environment, preferring the
lazy joys of indolence rather than labor for the benefit of his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>oppressors. Naturally. Recent events, however,
show that, given the stimulant of hope, even the &ldquo;indolent
natives&rdquo; of the Philippines can achieve and nobly dare.</p>
<p>Some Spaniards also have asserted that the Filipinos are naturally
disloyal and treacherous, and that their word is not to be depended
on.</p>
<p>Now, the whole world knows that they have every reason to be
disloyal to the Spaniard, who has for centuries so cruelly oppressed
them. The devotion to the cause of freedom, however, which has recently
made Rizal and hundreds of others martyrs to Spanish cruelty, shows
that they also have the stuff that heroes are made of, and that they
can be loyal to an animating principle.</p>
<p>In many places the natives are unwilling to work without pay in
advance, and this has been a great drawback to investors. For, after
receiving their money, they frequently refuse to perform a stroke of
work, knowing that their employer has no remedy except in the dilatory
process of the courts, which would only increase his expense and
exaggerate his troubles. This has no terrors for the native. While, of
course, this is to be deprecated, it may be remedied by gaining the
confidence of the natives; for it is undoubtedly the result of
generations of Spanish robbery, where these people were forced to labor
for their employers,&mdash;frequently the priests,&mdash;having no
reward save the lash or promises of a golden crown in heaven. They,
therefore, naturally look upon investors with some suspicion. However,
in the more civilized districts, where modern and humane business
methods prevail, hundreds of thousands are employed, to the profit both
of themselves and their employers.</p>
<p>Though calm, the native is not secretive, but often loquacious. He
is naturally curious and inquisitive, but always polite, and respectful
withal&mdash;especially to his superiors. He is passionate, and, in
common with all half-civilized races, is cruel to his foes. The quality
of mercy, like the sentiment&mdash;as distinguished from the
passion&mdash;of love, is perhaps more the product of the philosophy of
civilization than a natural attribute of the human heart. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>romantic history of Medi&aelig;val Europe, as
compared with the placid present, is proof of this.</p>
<p>All travelers unite in attributing to the natives extreme family
affection. They are very fond of their children, who, as a rule, are
respectful and well-behaved. The noisy little hoodlums of European and
American cities are utterly unknown. The old are tenderly cared for,
and are venerated; while in almost every well-to-do household are one
or two poor relatives who, while mere hangers-on, are, nevertheless,
always made welcome to the table of their host. Indeed, the hospitality
of the Filipinos is proverbial. A guest is always welcome, and welcome
to the best. The better class, too, gladly embrace every opportunity to
feast their neighbors or the stranger within their gates.</p>

<p>As a rule, the people are superstitious and very credulous; but how
could they be otherwise? For three hundred years they have been denied
even the liberty of investigation; when no light, save the dim glimmer
of priestcraft pierced the utter darkness of their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>lot.
Those that have been educated, however, have proved apt
converts&mdash;only too apt say the priests and the Spaniards&mdash;to
the conclusions of Science and of modern research.</p>

</div>
<p>The native is rarely humorous and seldom witty. He is not easily
moved to anger, and when angry does not often show it. When he does,
like the Malay of Java, he is prone to lose all control of himself,
and, with destructive energy, slays all in his path. This is
infrequent, however, but is a contingency that may occur at any
time.</p>
<p>If a native has been unjustly punished, he will never forget it, and
will treasure the memory of his wrong until a good opportunity for
revenge presents itself.</p>
<p>Like all courageous people, he despises cowardice and pusillanimity.
He has, therefore, but little regard for the meek and humble Chinaman,
who will pocket an insult rather than <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>avenge himself. He
greatly esteems the European, who is possessed of the qualities that he
admires, and will follow him into the very jaws of death. He is easily
awed by a demonstration of superior force, and is ruled best by mild
but firm coercion,&mdash;based upon justice. He is not often ambitious,
save socially, and to make some display, being fond of ceremony and of
the pomp and glitter of a procession. He is sober, patient, and always
clean. This can be said of few peoples. He easily adjusts himself to
new conditions, and will soon make the best of his surroundings. As
servants they are honest, obedient, and will do as they are told.</p>
<p>It must be said that they enjoy litigation more than is good for
them or for the best interests of the colony. There must be some
psychological reason for this. It doubtless gives some play to the
subtlety of the Oriental mind. It is said that he lacks the sense of
initiative; and to some extent this may be true. The recent conduct of
Aguinaldo&mdash;a full-blooded native&mdash;proves, notwithstanding,
that he is not wholly deficient in aggressiveness nor in organizing
power.</p>
<p>Though not as artistic as the Japanese, the Filipinos have shown
many evidences of art talent. This is seen in the embroidery of the
women, as well as in the work of the native painters and sculptors.
Some of these have been honored with high prizes at the Art Exhibition
in Madrid. I remember particularly the brothers Luna: one educated in
Spain, and there distinguished by his remarkable talent with the brush;
the other known for his wonderful virtuosity.</p>
<p>Moreover, in nothing are the Filipinos so proficient as in music.
Every village has its orchestra, and in the evening the whole district
turns out to enjoy its playing.</p>
<p>All the people are, in fact, born musicians; even little boys and
girls of five or six years of age play the harp, the guitar, or the
piano as if by instinct; while their elders show a proficiency that,
when their opportunities are considered, is truly astonishing. The
clergy, appreciating that music is the foe of vice and a promoter of
virtue, have wisely encouraged the natives <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>in this
art. It is now taught in all the higher schools in the colony.</p>
<p>At the many feasts, religious and secular, which are the delight of
the natives, music is always the most enjoyable feature, the bands
playing for hours together, both performers and listeners being so
engrossed as to be wholly unconscious of the lapse of time.</p>

<h3 class="main">A Native Wedding.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The native usually marries early,&mdash;the brides
often but eleven or twelve years of age. A marriage-feast is entered
into with pomp and ceremony. It is a not unimportant occasion for the
priest also, who usually sets the day, and expects a large
fee,&mdash;dependent upon the wealth of the contracting parties. The
evening before the ceremony, both bride and groom go to confession, to
receive absolution. About five o&rsquo;clock the following morning they
leave the house of the bride, joined by a long procession of
relatives.</p>
<p>After mass has been said, the bride and groom stand before the
priest, who places over their shoulders a thick mantle, which is to
typify the bodily union. He then recites his formula and asks the usual
questions. To these both respond in the same low voice characteristic
of such replies the world over. As the wedded pair are leaving the
church, a bowl of coin is passed to them. The new husband stops, takes
a handful and gives it to his wife, who receives it and returns it to
the bowl. This is a token that he gives to her his worldly goods. All
then solemnly return to the paternal residence, where, meanwhile, a
banquet has been prepared.</p>
<p>This feast is called Catapusan which means a gathering of friends.
All the notables of the village, as well as all the relatives on both
sides, are invited to it. The table is loaded with the good things of
the season. Light liquors, chocolate, and sweetmeats are then offered
to the guests, with betel-nuts and cigars and cigarettes. <span class=

<p>The dancing now begins. A youth and a maiden stand facing each
other, both singing a sentimental song. Then follows a musical
dialogue, while both dance round each other, keeping step to the music
furnished by the native orchestra. A young woman then steps into the
middle of the floor,&mdash;her long hair flowing down her back, her
eyes sparkling. The music begins in a low plaintive key, that gradually
becomes more and more forlorn, while her languid movements express
various degrees of sorrow. Gradually the strain flows into a livelier
measure, and she becomes more and more animated, until at last she
sinks down in a whirl of delirious passion. Then, again, a girl dances
with a glass of water on her head; or some other form of entertainment
is given.</p>

<p>After the dancing, the men and women retire to their respective
quarters.</p>
<p>The marriage is always arranged by the parents of the two young
persons, who go through an established etiquette of advance and refusal
before the dowry terms are arranged. If the parents of the young man
are poor and he can offer no dowry, he often <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>enters
the household of his intended on probation,&mdash;as Jacob did to win
Rachael.</p>
<p>The wedding-feast is always given by the father of the groom, who
also furnishes the dowry for the bride. The young married couple then
live with the parents of one of the parties. The wife always remains
mistress of her own property, and the husband can in no event inherit
it. The children often add the surname of the mother to that of the
father, thus making the woman of greater prominence.</p>
<p>Before the middle of the century there were no distinct family
surnames, and there were, consequently, no complications of families
possible. To introduce greater simplicity into the laws of inheritance,
the names of distinguished Spanish families were introduced into the
colony,&mdash;each family receiving a distinct appellation.</p>

<p class="first">The men are usually of medium height, lithe, and of a
rich brown color, with large cheek-bones, bright eyes and immobile
countenances. The better kind dress in loose shirts, or blouses, worn
outside the trousers and of native manufacture, made of abac&aacute;,
or Manila hemp; or of the airy, delicate, and almost transparent
pi&ntilde;a,&mdash;a texture of pine-apple leaf, as choice as the
finest lace.</p>
<p>This is of white, or light yellow, and often interwoven with red,
green or blue silk, or embroidered with flowers. The white or
light-colored trousers are fastened round the waist with a belt. The
feet are sometimes bare, or protected by sandals or patent-leather
shoes. On the head is usually worn a salacot&mdash;a large round hat,
strongly plaited with gray-and-black intersecting patterns of nito or
liana fibre, the brim ornamented with a band of embroidered cloth or
silver.</p>
<p>The dress of the poorer class is very similar&mdash;the material
being coarser, the colors red and orange predominating.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Full-blooded Native Girl in Reception Attire.</p>
</div>
<p>The woman wears a flowing skirt of gay colors&mdash;bright red,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>green or white&mdash;with a silken saya or sarong
of many colors. Over this is a narrower waist-cloth usually of silk and
of a darker color. Over the breast and shoulders is generally thrown a
starched neckcloth of beautiful embroidered pi&ntilde;a&mdash;folded
triangularly, the points fitting in the hollow of the V-shaped
chemisette. On the head is worn a white mantle, from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>which
the rippling cataract of raven hair falls in massy folds almost to the
ground. The toes of the naked feet are enveloped in chinelas,&mdash;a
heelless slipper, which is shuffled with languorous grace.</p>
<p>Many of the women are pretty, and all are good-natured and smiling.
Their complexion, of light brown, is usually clear and smooth; their
eyes are large and lustrous, full of the sleeping passion of the
Orient. The figures of the women are usually erect and stately, and
many are models of grace and beauty.</p>
<p>The women of every class are far more industrious than the men, and
also more cheerful and devout. Adultery is almost unheard of. The men,
however, are exceedingly jealous. The natives believe that during sleep
the soul is absent from the body, and they say that if one be suddenly
wakened they fear the soul may not be able to return. Therefore, they
are extremely careful not to waken anyone rudely or suddenly, but
always call with softly-rising and falling tones, to bring the sleeper
gradually to consciousness.</p>
<p>The preceding observations concerning the Tagalogs, the natives of
the north, are also, in the main, true of the Visayos, their southern
brethren. The latter, however, are not so cheerful or so hospitable,
and are more ostentatious and aggressive. Their women, too, are more
vain and avaricious. These slight differences are perhaps due to the
fact that they have far less intercourse with the civilized world than
the Tagalogs.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Half-breeds, or Mestizos.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">No less interesting, and even more influential than
the natives, are the half-breeds, or mestizos. They form a large
percentage of the population. These are usually of native mothers and
of Spanish or Chinese fathers. The Spanish fathers are, however, a
distinct class from the Chinese fathers, and rank much higher socially,
exchanging visits with the pure Spanish. They are, most always, a
handsome race, and more intelligent than the pure natives, and far more
energetic and ambitious. Among them are many leading merchants and men
of influence. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p>The mestiza girls are, as a rule, often of wonderful beauty. They
are lithe and graceful and of a soft olive complexion, with red lips,
pearly teeth, and ravishing black eyes, whose long lashes droop
coquettishly in response to the admiring glance of a stranger. Their
dancing is justly famed, and those educated in the convents are musical
and often accomplished in other ways. The peculiar characteristics and
the increase of energy due to this infusion of European blood, however,
disappear if no further admixture takes place in the second generation.
It is more lasting, on the other hand, where the Malay has been crossed
with the Chinese. This is probably due to the great similarity of the
two races.</p>
<p>These Malays, with an infusion of Chinese, are called
mestizo-Chinos. They also are more intelligent than the pure Malay, and
far more shrewd. Many of the leading merchants of Manila are of this
mixture. They do not, however, enjoy the confidence of the people, and
are a tricky and disturbing element in the population. They have the
mongrel stamp and a cunning, shifty look. They are full of intrigue
too, and it was, indeed, because they formed so large a part of the
rebels that the high-class natives hesitated so long about joining the
insurgents; not wishing to combine even with the despised
mestizo-Chinos against the hated Spanish; for the government of the
latter was preferable to that of the former.</p>

<h3 class="main">Savage Tribes in the Interior: Aetas, or
Negritos.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Over all the islands are scattered a mountain tribe
called Aetas, or Negritos. These are supposed to be the aborigines.
They are very dark, some being as black as negroes. They are doubtless
of African descent and are said to resemble the natives of New Guinea.
Their hair is black, curly, and matted. They go almost naked, and have
but little self-respect. They are also puny, stupid, and ugly, and of a
low order of intellect, incapable of improvement, and deficient in
judgment and in aggressiveness. They are, on the other hand, remarkably
fleet <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>of foot. They subsist mainly by hunting. Their
usual weapons are a lance of bamboo, a palm-wood bow, and a quiver of
poisoned arrows.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e2402width" id="p095"><img src="images/p095.jpg"
alt="Negritos Enjoying a Primitive Sun-shade." width="444" height=

<p class="figureHead">Negritos Enjoying a Primitive Sun-shade.</p>
</div>
<p>About fifty families commonly live together, and their villages of
rude, thatched huts, raised on bamboo poles high from the ground,
present a curious appearance. They were the original lords of the
islands, and when the first Malays settled here, they, with unfailing
regularity, exacted tribute from the newcomers. The latter, however,
soon became too powerful, and the Negritos are now either employed by
the Tagalogs as servants, or they have fled to their retreats in the
mountains. But they are fast disappearing, and, hence, before many
generations, will have perished before the destructive blast of
progress.</p>
<p>Their principal food is fish, roots, fruits, and rice. They are
notorious cattle-thieves, swooping down upon the valley and carrying
their prey to their fastnesses in the mountains. Their agricultural
skill consists in scratching the soil with a stick and throwing in the
seed. They rarely ever spend more than one season in one locality, thus
constantly moving from place to place. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span></p>
<p>Their religion seems to consist in a deification of the supernatural
and of the mysterious. When the railroad was first constructed from
Manila to Dagupan, these Negritos constantly appeared along the track,
which they regarded with feelings of awe.</p>
<p>When the trial journey of the first locomotive took place, and that
huge iron salamander appeared thundering down the track, it is related
that they all fell upon their knees in abject terror, worshiping the
strange monster as some new and powerful deity.</p>
<p>Unlike most savages, they care tenderly for their aged, and are full
of reverence for their dead.</p>
<p>As a rule, too, they are independent of Spanish domination, and
neither pay taxes nor submit to enumeration for the census.</p>
<p>A few years ago the Government started a mission in Pampanga; a
great many Negritos were herded together, and were given a year&rsquo;s
provisions and tools to work with. Teachers were also provided, and all
went well as long as the provisions lasted. They refused to work,
however, and were averse to all restraint, and the second year they
returned to their native haunts.</p>
<p>They have a curious marriage custom. After a young man has shown his
passion for a girl, and his advances have been well received by the
parents of his intended, he catches her in his arms. She breaks loose,
however, and runs. He follows hard behind. Again he catches her. She
resists, and once more frees herself, running away from the eager arms
of her ardent lover. After this play of struggle and chase have been
kept up a little while, she finally yields, and he leads her
triumphantly back to her home.</p>

<p>The father of the bride now drags the youth up a rude ladder to the
floor of the elevated hut; the mother likewise leads up her daughter.
They are then made to kneel down, when the old man throws a
cocoanut-shell full of water over the pair. He then bumps their heads
together, and they are adjudged man and wife. They spend their
honeymoon in the mountains, where, in undisturbed and shelterless
connubial bliss, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=

<p class="first">In the northwestern part of Luzon is a fierce,
unsubdued tribe known as the Gaddanes. They are very dark and strong,
and present a fine appearance, armed with long, sharp spears and with
bows and arrows. They wear their hair down to their shoulders, and,
like the American Indians, take the scalps of their enemies slain in
battle; these the young men present to the fathers of their intended as
a proof of their valor.</p>
<p>This takes place when the fire-tree bursts into bloom; its fiery
blossoms have, to their minds, a certain religious significance. It is
then they collect all trophies of war, and perform the rude rites of
their nature-worship. They subsist on fish, game, and fruit.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A fine race are the Igorrotes, spread over the
northern half of Luzon. They are copper-colored, and also wear their
hair long. A few are bearded. Their shoulders are broad, and their
limbs brawny and powerful. Because of their high cheek-bones, flat
noses, and thick lips, they would not, however, by a European or an
American, be considered good-looking.</p>
<p>They cultivate sugar-cane, rice, and sweet-potatoes, but have never
been able to give up their savage customs for civilization. Their
houses are not unlike the huts of the Esquimaux. Polygamy sometimes
exists, but adultery is almost unknown. Murder is said to be frequent,
and family feuds often take off great numbers.</p>
<p>Their depredations in the interior are often of great annoyance to
the domesticated natives; for they carry off their cattle <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>and
their crops. Many expeditions have, from time to time, been made by the
Spaniards against them; but all have signally failed. The Igorrotes
obstinately refuse to be civilized. Spanish dominion holds for these
liberty-loving people few advantages; Catholicism offers them little
peace; while they maintain that the traditional heaven of the European
would not at all suit them.</p>

<p>Upon one occasion a Catholic priest was horrified when an Igorrote
asked him why it was that no black man ever became a white man&rsquo;s
Saint? When told that it was possible, he refused to believe it, saying
that he, for his part, was content with the religion of his ancestors,
and did not intend to bend his knees in adoration of the gods of the
pale-faces. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=

escape the advancing Spaniards, hid in the hills, where they
intermarried with the Igorrotes, their descendants, whom they much
resemble, with, however, some important differences. For, with the
cunning and the shrewdness of their Chinese ancestors, they combine the
Igorrote fierceness and independence. Many of these have been

<h3 class="main">The Tinguianes.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the district of El Abra, in Luzon, are the
Tinguianes, who are semi-civilized and under the control of the
Spaniards. They prefer, however, their own laws to those of the Spanish
code, and usually abide by them. If a man is accused of a crime and he
denies it, the head-man of his village, who is also the judge, causes a
handful of straw to be burnt in his presence. The accused then holds up
an earthen pot and says: &ldquo;May my belly be changed to a pot like
this if I am guilty of the crime of which I am accused.&rdquo; If he
remains unchanged in body, the judge declares him innocent.</p>
<p>The head-man himself, upon assuming his office, takes the following
curious oath: &ldquo;May a destructive whirlwind kill me, may the
lightning strike me, and may an alligator devour me when I am asleep if
I fail to do my duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They are pagans, and they believe that their gods will answer
prayer. For worship, they resort to their caves in the mountains. When
a child is to be named, it is carried to the woods, where the priest
raises a knife over its head, at the same time pronouncing a name. He
then, with the knife, strikes a tree. If sap flows forth, the name is
deemed good; if not, he goes through the same ceremony until the
desired result is produced; the god, then, is supposed to have given
his consent. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span></p>
<p>They are very intelligent, and are a well-formed race, and many are
handsome, with aquiline noses. On the crown of the head they wear a
tuft of hair, like the Japanese. Like the domesticated natives, they
are very fond of music and of dress. They tattoo their bodies and also
black their teeth, and are supposed to have descended from the
shipwrecked Japanese cast upon the island.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Chinese: Hated but Indispensable.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long before the Spanish occupation, Chinese
trading-junks stopped at the Philippine Islands; and, after the
founding of Manila, being well received by the Spaniards, who depended
upon them for many necessities, they established trading-posts in
various parts of the colony.</p>
<p>In 1580 the Government built the Alcayceria&mdash;a large building
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>that was used as a kind of Chinese market. Here
were situated all the Chinese shops, which it was thought better to
confine to one locality: they might be regulated the more easily.</p>
<p>The Alcayceria proved too small, however, and the shops were soon in
every part of the Binondo. Other centres were soon provided for them,
where the Government protected and even encouraged the enterprise of
the Chinamen.</p>
<p>The native and the Spanish merchants becoming alarmed at the
increase of the Celestials, began an agitation, whose object was to
limit their number to 6,000; but the movement received little
encouragement from the Government, which drew a large revenue from the
Chinamen.</p>
<p>In 1755 this agitation was renewed, and it was resolved to expel all
non-Christian Chinese. The day before the law went into effect 515
asked for and obtained baptism, while over 1100 desired to stay, that
they might study the mysteries of the Christian religion. More than
2,000 were banished from the colony. In 1603 two Chinese mandarins,
accompanied by a large retinue, came to Manila to make inquiries
concerning a mountain of gold that some of their countrymen had said
was located near Cavite. They were received with much ceremony, and the
Governor-General allowed them to pursue their quest. It proved
fruitless, of course.</p>
<p>Persuaded that they had been deceived, they sailed away, leaving the
colony in a fever of speculation as to the real object of their visit.
Various rumors sprang up in Manila; all to the effect that the Chinese
Emperor contemplated the conquest of the colony, and that the Chinese
population were fomenting an insurrection to aid his designs. They were
also accused of secreting arms, and many outbreaks from time to time
arose against them, until finally the poor Chinese, beset on every
hand, and hourly menaced by secret assassination and open violence,
were forced to assume the offensive. Accordingly, they raised
fortifications, and on the eve of St. Francis&rsquo; day they opened
hostilities by attacking one of the suburbs of the city. With the
beating of gongs and the flying of colors <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>they next besieged
Binondo itself, burning houses and committing many other outrages on
the way.</p>
<p>The Spaniards gallantly advanced to repel them, and
Dasmari&ntilde;as, the ex-Governor-General, led the attack with the
flower of his countrymen; but the odds against them were too great, and
scarcely a man was left to tell the tale of their defeat.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Chinese Merchants on Their Way to the Joss

</div>
<p>The Chinese, flushed with success, now besieged the city itself,
but, running short of provisions,&mdash;which the natives were,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>of course, unwilling to furnish them,&mdash;they
were finally compelled to give up the siege.</p>
<p>As they retreated, the Spaniards, constantly reinforced by bands of
natives, pursued them, killing thousands on the way. They were then
finally driven into the interior, where the same fate awaited
them&mdash;of whom not less than 24,000 were killed and taken
prisoners.</p>
<p>In 1639 some Chinese traders, in the town of Calamba, Laguna
province, exasperated beyond endurance by the insults and outrages
heaped upon them by the Spanish Governor, killed this official and one
or two of his subordinates, and flew to open rebellion. The Chinese all
over the colony joined the rebels, and it is estimated that not less
than 30,000 Chinese were under arms. This lasted nearly a year, and
resulted in the surrender of the Chinese; most of whom, however, were
spared.</p>
<p>In 1660 there was another rising and a massacre. The Chinese,
nevertheless, were still allowed to remain. They were so important a
part of the commercial life of the province they could not long be
spared. For more than a century the Chinese now pursued their
avocations in absolute security.</p>
<p>When, however, in 1763 they joined the British invaders, little
mercy was shown them by the Spaniards, who killed several
thousands.</p>
<p>In 1820 the natives began the massacre of the Chinese and other
foreigners, whom they accused of poisoning the drinking water, thus
producing an epidemic of cholera.</p>
<p>Only since 1843 have the Chinese shops been opened on the same terms
as those of other foreigners. But there is no doubt that the Chinese
have been a great boon to the colony. They have had, in the main, a
civilizing influence on the natives, and have taught them many
important things: as the working of iron and the manufacture of sugar
from the juice of the sugar-cane. They have also ever been the leaders
in commerce and the chief middlemen of the colony; and, for this reason
mainly they have been deemed an unwelcome necessity; for, without them,
trade would almost be brought <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105"
href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>to a standstill, and, in
consequence, labor would suffer and living be rendered dearer to every
class.</p>
<p>By their superior shrewdness and unscrupulous cunning they have, on
the other hand, excited the hatred of the natives, who despise them for
their cowardice. Thus, from time to time, the feeling against them is
very bitter.</p>

<p>Another objection against the Celestial is that he underbids all
competitors, working for what others deem less than living wages.
Furthermore, he spends little, and all that he saves he carries to his
own country. Their expulsion, however, would be as unwise as it is
impracticable, and the only remedy that meets the case is a proper
State-control. The employment of coolie labor, notwithstanding, is at
present impossible, on account of the hatred that the lower-class
natives feel toward them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href=

<p>In Manila there are at present no less than 40,000 Chinese, while
the whole colony contains about 100,000. They have their own courts,
their guilds, and secret societies, which are necessary for their
self-protection, and they choose representative deputations to
represent them in the Government.</p>

<p class="first">In the lower part of the Philippine group, in the
islands of Sulu and Mindanao, the Catholic Spanish conqueror early came
into conflict with a religion not less intense and fanatical than his
own. The story of this fierce struggle between Malay Mussulman and
Spanish Catholic reads not unlike the more celebrated conflict between
Christian and Mohammedan in the days of good King Ferdinand and pious
Isabella. Here, too, was waged that dire battle of the creeds that
deluged half of Europe with holy blood. Here, too, was mutual advance
and retreat, but no reconciliation&mdash;no conversion.</p>
<p>The island of Sulu, on account of its position between Mindanao and
Borneo, became, in this wise, populated by the followers of the
Prophet: About three centuries ago Paguian Tindig, a Borneo chief,
quarreled with his brother and was forced to flee for his life. He
landed on Sulu Island, where he soon achieved great fame as a warrior.
His cousin, Adasaolan, who had accompanied him, had taken up his abode
in Basilan. Here he lorded it over the natives, but acknowledged the
suzerainty of the Spaniards.</p>
<p>Adasaolan married a Mahometan princess&mdash;a daughter of the King
of Mindanao, where, it appears, Islamism had been carried by Arab
missionaries. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span></p>
<p>Soon afterward, Adasaolan, longing for the possession of the fat
acres of Sulu, attacked his cousin Tindig, and vanquished that intrepid
soldier, who died fighting bravely. However, Rajah Bongso, and not
Adasaolan, succeeded Tindig. Nevertheless, Adasaolan had, with the aid
of friends from Borneo and Mindanao, introduced Mahometanism into Sulu,
which has since become the Mecca of the Philippines.</p>

<p>In 1596 the Spaniards sent an expedition to Mindanao, but were
repulsed. Their ravages and constant desire for conquest embittered the
Mohammedans,&mdash;who, retaliating, began to fit out expeditions
against their Christian enemies; like birds of prey they hovered round
the bays with their prahus, penetrating every inlet. These pirates soon
became the terror of the Spanish coasts, and were as brave as they were
merciless. For three centuries they preyed upon Spanish merchantmen,
pillaged the northern towns and villages, massacring the old and
helpless, leading thousands of Christian women into concubinage, and
tens of thousands of able-bodied men into slavery. Myriads were thus
murdered, and incalculable damage done, all because of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>continued attempt of the Spaniards to win their
southern neighbors to their own faith.</p>
<p>In 1750 the Sultan Mahamed Alimudin, having been deposed by his
brother, Prince Bantilan, visited Manila. He was lavishly entertained
by the Priest-Governor, who was unceasing in his efforts to persuade
him to <span class="corr" id="xd21e2570" title=
"Source: renounce">embrace</span> Christianity. The Sultan at last
yielded and was baptized. He was christened Ferdinand I. of Sulu. The
rank of a Spanish Lieutenant-General was also accorded him.</p>
<p>All this was done with great pomp and ceremony. <i>Te Deums</i> were
sung in all the churches; glittering processions marched daily through
the streets; comedies were acted on the streets, for the benefit of the
populace, who shared in the general rejoicing: bull-fights and other
equally delightful and harmless recreations were also the order of the
day&mdash;all given at the expense of the Church, which regarded the
conversion of the Head of the hated Mussulmans as an event of no
ordinary importance.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Sultan&rsquo;s State.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Sultan lived in great state. He had a retinue of
sixty persons, and was accompanied by many of the princes of the blood.
All lived on the generous bounty of Spain.</p>
<p>Measures were now apparently begun to restore the deposed monarch to
his throne. But the Spaniards pretended to discover that the Sultan
harbored designs against them, and that he possessed a secret
preference for the Mussulman faith. For this crime he, with all his
relatives and retainers, 160 in number, was cast into prison, where he
was confined several years.</p>
<p>A decree of extermination was then declared against the Mohammedans.
A fleet of ships, carrying 2000 men, at once proceeded to Sulu, which
the natives defended most ably. The Spanish campaign proved a dismal
failure, and awful were the reprisals of the infuriated Mussulmans.</p>
<p>In 1755 most of the Sultan&rsquo;s suite was sent back to Sulu,
though the Sultan himself was still kept in close confinement.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span></p>
<p>The wily Mohammedan again professed Christianity; but, though the
Sultan was henceforth treated with greater leniency, he was not
released: he remained captive in Manila until the occupation of the
British, in 1763, who restored him to his throne in Sulu.</p>
<p>As might be expected, Mahamed lost no opportunity to avenge the
insults that his hereditary enemies had for so many years been heaping
upon him; accordingly, he led several incursions against them.</p>

</div>
<p>I have not space here to recount the various expeditions of the
Spaniards against their southern neighbors. I shall, instead, mention
only the more prominent ones of recent years.</p>
<p>In 1851, Sulu Town, the capital of Sulu, was attacked and razed by
the Spaniards. Their advantage, however, proved but temporary. The
Mohammedans now changed their capital to Maybun on the south coast,
which is far less accessible.</p>
<p>In 1860, Governor-General Norzagaray led another expedition against
the Mohammedans. This also met with some success; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>but
none of it was decisive. On account of the persistent renewals of the
hated Sulu piracy in 1876, another expedition, under Vice-Admiral
Malcampo, pierced the interior of Sulu, where he was ambushed and
attacked by a body of juramentados,&mdash;formidable fanatics, armed
with javelins and the deadly kris. He returned to Manila having
sustained great loss.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Dreaded Juramentados.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These juramentados are Mohammedans, who, having taken
an inviolable oath to shed the blood of the hated Christian, and,
having absolutely no fear of death, are as dangerous as they are
fanatical.</p>

<p class="figureHead">A Bamboo Thicket in Sulu.</p>
</div>
<p>By the laws of Sulu, the bankrupt debtor is the slave of his
creditor; and not only he, but likewise his wife and children, whom he
can free only by the sacrifice of his life&mdash;by enrolling himself
in the ranks of the juramentados, who combine the performance of a
religious duty with the patriotic pleasure of killing their Christian
enemy. The panditas, or priests, encourage him in this resolve until he
is brought to a very frenzy of enthusiasm. In their meetings the
priests sing to these sworn assassins impassioned chants, that hold out
the most entrancing visions of the joys of Paradise, perpetual
happiness, and the honeyed kisses and rapturous embraces of beautiful
houris. Similar to the Druids of old, they, too, stand like avenging
deities in the religious gloom of the forests, and incite these
fanatics to the destruction of their enemies: they promise eternal
reward; holding up to their excited imaginations delightful pictures of
sensual enjoyment.</p>
<p>Thus lashed into a fury of madness, the juramentado becomes more
beast than human, and is forever lusting for murder. He oils his supple
limbs and rushes ferociously into the conflict. Nothing can stay him.
He knows that he is going to certain death&mdash;that is but the door
to Paradise! In his excitement he feels no pain; and, though severely
wounded, he will continue his furious onset until killed. Hence, he
cares not how many oppose <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href=
"#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span>him; the more the better; he will
probably succeed in doing greater execution.</p>
<p>A distinguished French scientist, Dr. Montano, gives a vivid
description of the entry of eleven juramentados into the village of
Tianzgi. Divided into three or four bands they secretly entered the
town, by concealing themselves, with their krises, in loads of fodder
that they pretended to have for sale. After stabbing the guards they
rushed up the street,&mdash;striking at all whom they met.</p>
<p>The soldiers in the garrison, hearing the cry &ldquo;<i lang=
"es">Los juramentados!</i>&rdquo; seized their guns and advanced to
meet them.</p>
<p>The mad Mahometans rushed blindly on them, cutting and slashing
right and left. Again and again, though shot and shattered by the hail
of bullets, they rose and flung themselves upon their enemies. One of
them, though transfixed by a bayonet, remained erect,&mdash;struggling
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>fiercely to reach the soldier that had impaled
him. Nor would he cease his furious efforts till another soldier had
blown his brains out with a pistol. Before all of the juramentados
could be killed, they had hacked fifteen soldiers to pieces, besides
wounding many others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what wounds!&rdquo; says Dr. Montano; &ldquo;the head of
one corpse is cut off as clean as if it had been done with a razor;
another soldier is cut almost in two. The first of the wounded to come
under my hand was a soldier of the Third Regiment, who was mounting
guard at the gate through which some of the assassins entered. His left
arm was fractured in three places; his shoulder and breast were
literally cut up like mince-meat; amputation appeared to be the only
chance for him; but in that lacerated flesh there was no longer a spot
from which could be cut a shred.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Extent of Mohammedan Rule.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Mussulmans are, indeed, over the whole of the
island of Mindanao. It is under the Sultanate of Sulu, there being two
Sultanates in the island. Not more than a fourth of Mindanao is under
Spanish rule, although by an old treaty, never enforced, Spain claimed
suzerainty over all the territory subject to the Sultan of Sulu. This
treaty was formally recognized at the close of the war of 1876.</p>
<p>In the interior of Mindanao are many fierce and savage tribes,
owning allegiance to no government, controlled only by their own fierce
passions.</p>
<p>A bagani, or man of might, is one that has won recognition by having
cut off sixty heads. This entitles him to wear a scarlet turban. No one
not a bagani can be a chief. Thus, murder and assassination are
legalized and honored.</p>
<p>The Mandayas, to escape from the baganis, are wont to build their
huts in the branches of lofty trees, thirty or forty feet from the
ground. Here they climb when attacked, defending themselves by hurling
stones upon their assailants. The baganis usually <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>attempt to take them by surprise, shooting
burning arrows at the &aelig;rial habitation, that they may set it on
fire. Sometimes, it is said, the bagani will climb up to the hut with
their shields locked together above them. Then, cutting down the posts
that support this abode in the tree-tops, they soon bring the besieged
to terms. The captives are then divided among the besiegers&mdash;the
heads of the dead and of the wounded, and of all the grown males, are
cut off, and the women and children are carried away captives.</p>

<p class="figureHead">The Devil&rsquo;s Bridge, in Wild Laguna.</p>
</div>
<p>Such is the interior of Mindanao; and from this description it can
readily be seen how ineffective has been the Spanish occupation of that
island. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span></p>
<p>In 1877 a protocol was signed by England and Germany recognizing
Spain&rsquo;s rights to the Tawi-Tawi group and the chain of islands
from Sulu to Borneo.</p>
<p>In 1885 the heir to the Sultanate, having failed to appear in
Manila, where he had been cited to receive his investiture at the hands
of the Governor-General, as had for some years been the custom, another
chief, Datto Harun, was selected by the Spanish Government to take his
place. He took the oath of allegiance to the King of Spain, and was
supported in his office. Two years later several chiefs found another
pretext for rebellion, but they were finally compelled to yield their
submission. Over this trifling victory the Spaniards made a great
display.</p>
<p>Hardly had the Mohammedan chiefs submitted, when war broke out
afresh and Colonel Arolas was sent to the scene of the disturbance. He
defeated the natives in several engagements, and, at last, a permanent
peace was established. The Sulu protectorate comprises Sulu Mindanao,
and about 140 other islands; many of these are uninhabited. Next to
Luzon, Mindanao is the largest island in the Archipelago. Sulu is about
35 miles long and 12 miles broad. The population of Mindanao is
unknown. Luzon contains about 125,000 Mohammedans, many of whom are
slaves.</p>

<h3 class="main">Sulu Customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The fierce and conservative nature of the people, the
peculiar and long-rooted feudal laws, the presence of an ancient
dynasty, and of an ineradicable, fanatical belief,&mdash;these are a
few phases of the complex problem to be met now. So far, the Spaniards
have succeeded in maintaining their protectorate only by a protracted
military occupation, which, as I have said, has by no means been always
effective.</p>
<p>The Sulu Islanders dress with great taste. The women are fond of
bright colors and love to adorn themselves with jewelry. They have the
baggy nether dual-garment, so dear to all other women of their faith.
Their tight-fitting bodice is usually <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb116" href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>covered with
arabesque designs. In embroidering them they show great skill. For a
head-covering they wear the jabul, a long strip of stuff, sewn like a
deep narrow sack, open at the sides. This, if allowed to fall, would
reach down to the feet; the end, however, is always held under the arm.
The women are usually very graceful, and many are also pretty.</p>

alt="A Jungle in Luzon" width="704" height="539">
<p class="figureHead">A Jungle in Luzon</p>
</div>
<p>The men wear tight breeches, usually a scarlet, or of some other
bright, color. On the sides are rows of shining buttons, that give a
very dazzling effect. A buttoned waistcoat, a jacket with close-fitting
sleeves, and a turban complete a costume that is as picturesque as it
is unique. The men are handsome and very robust, lithe and active.
Their complexion is a dusky bronze, and they have piercing black eyes.
Their forehead is low, and their black hair falls in glossy waves upon
the neck. Though brave and daring to an extraordinary degree, they are
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>conservative and cautious&mdash;no less quick in
mind than agile in body, and always sober and self-contained. They are
extremely suspicious, and as merciless when angry as they are obstinate
and vindictive. They are far more artistic than their Christian
neighbors in the north. Their coats of mail, krises, lances, swords,
and other weapons are of their own making. They are most skilful
navigators, too, which accounts for their success as pirates. All males
over sixteen years of age bear arms. The office of chief is hereditary.
When a chief dies, the pandita, or priest, chants a requiem, while the
attendants beat a hollow piece of wood that serves as a gong. The
neighbors rush in, and shout and stamp their feet while the body is
sprinkled with salt. A successor is then proclaimed. The panditas have
great power over their flocks, inciting them to frequent fasts and to
furious flagellations. Many and varied are the ceremonials of their
belief.</p>
<p>The Spanish Government derives no taxes from the Sulu Protectorate,
but gives the Sultan a pension of $2,400 a year. The Sultan is called
the Stainless One, and is the chief of both Church and State. He is an
irresponsible despot, and the head of the feudal system. The Sultanate
is hereditary under the Salic law. The Sultan has his Advisory Council
and his Ministers. He lives in considerable state in the centre of the
new capital, Maybun, in a large well-constructed palace of wood.</p>
<p>The roomy vestibule is always lined with an abundant display of
indigenous plants and shrubs, dazzling to the eye and intoxicating to
the senses. It is, indeed, as if the entire tropic realm had been
ravished of its richest, rarest, and most gorgeous specimens of
plant-life to glorify this spacious entrance-way. From there on to the
throne-room is of but little interest.</p>
<p>Of course, letters, despatches, or verbal requests of foreigners
have all to be transmitted through the official interpreter, servants
meanwhile flitting about, in the gayest and most ludicrous costumes,
offering betel-nut to each and everyone,&mdash;to the bevy of Sultanas
and to foreign guests, all seated on silken and highly embroidered
cushions scattered on the floor. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118"
href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the town of Maybun there is nothing to be seen of any note, but
the country round about is magnificent.</p>
<p>Slavery exists by birth and conquest. Rice, Indian corn, sugar-cane,
indigo, and coffee are the common products of the Sultanate. The chief
export is pearls, for which the natives dive often a hundred feet. They
frequently attack sharks, which they fight with the deadly kris, never
failing to come off victors.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Old City.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Manila, the capital of the Philippines, is situated on
the island of Luzon, at the mouth, and on the left bank, of the river
Pasig. It is in N. lat. 14&deg; 36&prime;, by E. long., 20&deg;
57&prime;. The city was founded in 1571. The present fortifications and
the walls and battlements of the old city were built by Chinese labor
in 1590, in the time of Governor-General Gomez Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as.
The walls are 2&frac14; miles long and are mounted with old and useless
cannon. These, however, were quite formidable in the early days of the
colony, and did great service against the successive invaders that
threatened its peace and safety.</p>
<p>The old city is almost surrounded by water. On the north is the
Pasig; on the west the sea; while moats flank the other two sides.
These moats are connected with the river by sluices; but they are sadly
in need of repair, and are filled with stagnant water and putrid
matter,&mdash;a continual menace to the health of the city.</p>
<p>Until 1852 the drawbridge, connecting the old city with the new, was
raised at night and the city closed, presenting the curious fact of a
feudal Spanish city in the heart of the tropics. In the citadel are the
Government offices; also the Post, Telegraph, and Custom offices,
various convents and colleges, an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120"
href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>Artillery depot, the
Cathedral, and eleven other churches. This part of the city presents a
dilapidated and medi&aelig;val appearance. The dull, narrow streets
have a sombre, monastic aspect; and one, therefore, is not surprised to
find that the gloomy superstitions of the 15th century hold Cimmerian
sway here, undisturbed by the dawn of Science. It seems the fit capital
of a despotism, a suitable home for tyranny and priestcraft.</p>
<p>Manila Bay is thirty miles from north to south, and about
twenty-five miles wide. On each side the entrance are steep volcanic
mountains. Ten miles from Manila, near the entrance of the bay, lies
Cavit&eacute;, which contains about 5,000 people. Here also is the
arsenal, a patent slip, and a garrison of 500 men. In the channel lies
the island of Corregidor, 640 feet high, and just beyond, the island of
Caballo, 420 feet high, both fortified. On each island stands a
lighthouse. Other fortified points are San Jos&eacute; and Tibonis.</p>
<p>Manila, however, is, like Batavia and Calcutta, a great
trade-centre. But I must leave the old city to find any signs of life
and progress.</p>

<h3 class="main">Binondo and the Suburbs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Binondo, on the northern shore of the Pasig, and
opposite the old city, is the business quarter. Here are the large
tobacco factories, which employ about 10,000 men, women, and children.
One factory alone, indeed, employs 2,000. The Manila wrappers and
Manila cheroots and cigars are famed the world over. The employees in
these factories earn on an average about 15 cents a day. With this they
are able to live very well; for food is cheap, and rent is even
cheaper. Most of the boys and men in these factories wear only a thin
pair of trousers, being naked from the waist up. The girls also have
but a slight covering. In the midst of every group of girls sits an old
woman, who acts as a kind of combined overseer and chaperon.</p>

<p class="figureHead">The Fashionable New Cathedral in Old Manila, and
the Ruins of the Old Cathedral, Destroyed by Earthquake, 1863.</p>
</div>
<p>The main street of Binondo is the Escolta, and here are situated the
commercial warehouses, the bazaars, and the European <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>shops. In the Rosario are the Chinese shops.
These are very small, and a dozen or more are usually grouped together.
In each, on the little counter, sits a Chinaman, casting accounts with
the ancient abacus. Another stands behind the counter and acts as
salesman; a third is in front drumming up <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e2730" title="Source: custom">customers</span>, very much after
the manner of Moses Cohn, Baxter street, New York. These Chinese
traders are exceedingly shrewd, and it is almost useless for the buyer
to attempt to secure a reduction in price; they have a uniform scale,
agreed upon by themselves. Many of these Chinese merchants are
fabulously rich; and all are prosperous and progressive, the natives
and the Europeans not being able to compete against them.</p>
<p>In the Escolta are many fine shops owned by Spaniards, mestizos,
Germans, English, and Americans. The Escolta, in the daytime, presents
an animated appearance: about ten thousand carriages pass here daily,
and a great volume of business is transacted. The commerce is yearly
increasing, too. The principal articles of export are honey, tobacco,
cigars, sugar, coffee, and indigo.</p>
<p>The laboring class live in Tondo, another suburb. Their dwellings
are covered with roofs of nipa thatch. The drainage around these huts
is very bad, and under them are pools of stagnant water, the cause of
great mortality among the natives. The endemic diseases of the islands
are swamp-fever, diarrh&oelig;a, beri-beri, and typhoid.</p>
<p>The traffic on the river along the Binondo shore is considerable.
The river is not navigable by the large ocean-liners; only by boats of
light draught.</p>
<p>The streets of Manila, for the most part, are badly paved and still
more badly lighted, though some of the public gardens have been
recently much improved in this respect.</p>
<p>Beyond Binondo lies the aristocratic suburb, San Miguel, where live
the wealthy European merchants and many of the Government officials.
Here are many elegant and imposing residences.</p>

happy people on the wide, cool verandas; men and women, boys and girls,
all smoking cigarillos. For everybody smokes&mdash;from the Spanish
grandee down to his native postilion.</p>
<p>A more contented people than the Filipinos surely do not exist.
Naturally averse to exertion, and possessing few wants, they accept the
dispensations of Providence with a philosophic acquiescence not far
removed from indifference. One day differs little from another. Upon
rising, early in the morning, they take a cup of chocolate or coffee.
At eight o&rsquo;clock they partake of a light breakfast, consisting of
two or three dishes and a dessert. The head of the family then goes to
his work, the women, meanwhile, attending to their household duties.
From twelve to one is tiffin&mdash;a heavy lunch, consisting of soup,
fish, meat, dessert, and coffee, including rice and curry. From one to
four all enjoy the luxury of a siesta, after which, from four to five,
they have chocolate and cakes served, exchange visits, go out riding,
or take some other kind of recreation. Dinner is at eight. This is
usually an elaborate meal, consisting of meats, fruits, and various
native delicacies. After dinner, different diversions, such as music
and dancing, make the evening an agreeable one. About eleven
o&rsquo;clock, the entire family goes to bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bed&rdquo; consists of a fine mat, and one narrow and one
long pillow. There are no sheets. Both men and women sleep in their
stockings and pajamas. Mosquito curtains are, of course, a
necessity.</p>

<p>All this, of course, applies to the better class of natives, whose
residences are often fine and commodious. Very few houses are more than
one story above the ground floor. If so, the extra story is uninhabited
or serves as a sleeping-place for the servants, or as a coach-house.
The roofs are usually of tin or iron, which makes them extremely hot in
summer. For this reason many houses are also covered with a thin layer
of nipa-palm, which is cooler. The ground-story is usually of stone or
brick; the upper of wood, with sliding windows of opaque sea-shells.
The bath-house <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>is really the greatest personal necessity in
Manila. For a daily bath is almost indispensable to health and
comfort.</p>

<h3 class="main">Educational and Charitable Institutions.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Most of the educational institutions of the colony are
in Manila, where the Department of Education has its headquarters. Many
of the native graduates of the various colleges go into the
professions; many of the poorer kind into teaching. The village
schoolmaster receives, on an average, about 180 dollars a year, and out
of even this miserable stipend he has to pay his own expenses to and
from the city once every month, to receive his salary. Thus, it can
readily be surmised that the cause of public education is not in as
prosperous a condition as it might be. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>children of the wealthy are sometimes sent
abroad&mdash;to Spain, France, or England&mdash;to be educated. I
myself went to St. John&rsquo;s College, London, and, afterward, to
Pension Roulet, Ne&ucirc;chatel, Switzerland.</p>

<p>The Royal and Pontifical University of St. Thomas, in Manila, is
maintained by the Dominicans. It has schools of theology and church
law, jurisprudence, notarial law, medicine, and pharmacy. In the
undergraduate department are 40 free scholarships for Spanish boys.</p>
<p>The college of San Jos&eacute; gives instruction in medicine and
pharmacy. The Dominican college of San Juan de Letran is justly
celebrated for its excellent equipment, and for its fine museums of
history and of the arts. It is attended exclusively by the sons of the
natives.</p>
<p>The Cambobong Orphan Asylum, under the care of the Augustinians,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>furnishes elementary instruction, and is a
preparatory school for the University. It also teaches book-keeping,
and provides a good business education.</p>
<p>The Mandaloya Asylum, of the same order and of the same grade, is
for girls, and teaches the proper performance of household duties and
the various feminine accomplishments.</p>
<p>Poor and demented children find shelter in the St. Joseph&rsquo;s
Home; while the Hospital of San Juan de Dios, founded in 1595, is open
to all. This institution has two chaplains, one head nurse, six
physicians, eight resident medical students, one pharmaceutist, and a
corps of trained nurses.</p>
<p>The Hospital of San Lazaro is for lepers. It was founded in 1578 by
the Franciscans, under rather peculiar and not uninteresting
circumstances. The Emperor of Japan, full of resentment at the attempts
of the Spaniards to convert his subjects to Christianity, sent the
infant colony a ship-load of lepers with his compliments, saying,
sarcastically, that he had no doubt but that the good brethren to whose
care he felt called upon to send these useless subjects of his kingdom,
would, in their exceeding love for souls, receive them most
gratefully.</p>
<p>The Spaniards, however, needless to say, were by no means delighted,
and were at first inclined to send the lepers back. Pity and Christian
feeling, however, at last prevailed, and this hospital was built to
receive them.</p>
<p>One of the most important organizations is the Chamber of Commerce.
There are also several good banks and a savings bank. Under the
Department of Charity and Health are several subordinate boards, all
conducive to public improvement.</p>
<p>The Royal Polytechnic Society has for its object the promotion of
the arts and the sciences. The Musical Society, the Spanish Casino, the
Manila Club, the German Casino, the Gun, Jockey, Lawn-tennis and
Bicycle clubs are highly successful social organizations. At Santa
Mesa, on the outskirts of the city, is a race-course, which in the
spring is very popular.</p>
<p>The mint is only for the striking of subsidiary coins. It has been
in operation but a few years. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128"

<p>There are six daily papers: <i lang="es">El Diario de Manila</i>,

<p>Tramways of a very primitive kind run in the principal streets.
There are also electric lights in the public parks, along the Luneta,
and in the finest business houses. A telephone system extends
throughout the city, and there is a railway&mdash;the only one in the
province&mdash;to Dagupan. It is a single track, and is 123 miles long.
It was opened to traffic November 23, 1892. An Englishman has secured
the contract, and English engines are used, whose speed is 45 miles an
hour. This road has paid more than ten per cent. to the shareholders.
There is also a steam road to Dagupan. Another branch railroad is under
construction <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>by the Government. Manila being on low
peat-ground,&mdash;considerably lower in fact than the lake of Laguna,
whose overflow forms the Pasig river,&mdash;in the wet season it seems
an Oriental Venice; for the numerous creeks and canals that intersect
the city and its suburbs are then flooded with water and thronged with
native boats. Drinking-water is carried to the city through pipes from
Santolan, on the river Pasig. Fountains are also distributed at
convenient places throughout the city, to which the poorer people have
access.</p>
<p>A new harbor is now under construction. For the payment of it
special dues have from time to time been imposed upon the trade of the
port: 2 per cent<span class="corr" id="xd21e2827" title=
"Not in source">.</span> on imports, 1 per cent. on exports, a tonnage
tax, and a duty on fishing-boats.</p>
<p>There are several theatres in Manila, but they are very inferior.
The opera is very popular, and is well supported. Foreign celebrities
sometimes visit Manila, when the audiences are most enthusiastic and
whole scenes are encored. In the theatre every one smokes, from the
fashionable ladies and gentlemen in full dress, to the half-naked
gallery-gods in the loft. Between the acts pretty mestiza flower-girls
pass to and fro offering their fragrant wares to the onlookers. A
theatre-night in Manila is one of unrestrained gayety&mdash;and the
fun-loving Filipinos rarely miss an opportunity to attend a show. In
the Palacio Square is a statue of Charles IV., and in front of the
Variedades is one of Queen Isabella.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Cathedral and the Governor-General&rsquo;s
Palace.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The churches are well worthy of a visit, being
picturesque and interesting. The Cathedral was founded in 1570, and has
several times been destroyed by earthquakes. The new Cathedral, on the
site of the old, which was destroyed by the earthquake of 1880, cost a
half-million dollars. It is an immense structure of brick and stone and
is the most imposing building in the colony. It is in old Manila, and
is celebrated for the splendor of its interior decorations and its
gorgeous altars. Here start and end most of the great religious
processions for which Manila is so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130"
href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>noted. The cost of
maintaining the Cathedral, including the salaries of the officiating
priests, is not far from $60,000 per annum.</p>
<p>The Church of San Francisco&mdash;also in old Manila&mdash;is the
oldest church in Manila. It is under the patronage of the Franciscans
and is very wealthy. The magnificence of its interior is
unrivalled.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Church of San Francisco, and the Old City

</div>
<p>The Governor-General&rsquo;s Palace is in Malacanan, a suburb of new
Manila. It is a low massive structure and occupies an immense area. It
is in the midst of a large garden&mdash;a veritable Paradise. It is on
the bank of the river Pasig, in a healthful locality, and commands a
fine view of the city and the river. The garden is famed for its
luxuriance. Here grow, in rich profusion, cocoanuts, bananas, lemons,
mangoes, and a wealth of flowers: the white champaca, the yellow
ilang-ilang with its exquisite perfume, gigantic orchids, and a
thousand other blooms. Among the trees and shrubbery of this gorgeous
Eden, wind broad garden paths paved with sea-shells. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span></p>
<p>Facing the river is a large balcony from which the Governor views
the yearly boat-race that takes place on the birthday of the King. This
boat-race is one of the great events of the year and is usually rowed
by native champions.</p>
<p>The interior of the Palace is of unusual splendor, and there is
evidence on every hand of great pomp and ceremony. A host of liveried
servants and numerous guards in showy uniforms are everywhere apparent.
There is an excellent library and a spacious ball-room, where
receptions are held, to which, several times a year, the &eacute;lite
of the city and distinguished visitors are invited.</p>
<p>The Governor rides in a carriage drawn by four horses, with several
outriders, who, by means of a shrill whistle, announce his approach.
All streets are instantly cleared and traffic suddenly ceases, every
one standing still to make respectful obeisance. On, on, they come, the
dashing four, with the postilions in scarlet jackets. The Governor,
dressed in civilian&rsquo;s dress, sits within&mdash;the picture of
dignity. He bows right and left, in that perfunctory way characteristic
of public dignitaries the world over, and the carriage passes on, while
the citizens resume their wonted demeanor and avocations.</p>
<p>The Jesuits support and manage a fine observatory. And there is a
large botanical garden, now neglected; but it could easily be made the
finest in the world. The English Club, in the suburbs, is noted for its
hospitality and for the delightful personality of its members. Most of
the hotels are bad, with poor accommodations. The Hotel de Oriente,
however, is a noteworthy exception.</p>
<p>The police of the city are natives, and are under military
discipline. The department of police is known as the Municipal Guard.
From 10 o&rsquo;clock at night until 5 o&rsquo;clock in the morning
night-watchmen patrol the city.</p>

<p>One is struck by the number of carriages in the thoroughfares, drawn
by pretty ponies of mixed Chinese and Andalusian breed. There are also
many hacks to hire. The drivers, too, are as civil in address as they
are moderate in their charges. There are three days in the year when
the ponies are given absolute rest. These are Holy Wednesday, Thursday,
and Good Friday,<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133"
name="pb133">133</a>]</span>&mdash;when no traffic is permitted, only
the Archbishop and the doctors being allowed to ride in carriages. On
these days the church-bells are muffled, and the people, dressed in
sombre black, walk solemnly in the various religious processions. A
vast concourse assembles in the several squares to await the toll that
shall announce the end of the fast and of this enforced abstinence from
labor and worldly care. As soon as the first stroke is given, there is
a mighty rush in every direction, a thousand ponies are trotted through
the streets, ten thousand natives renew their daily traffic with
clamorous zeal, which shows how feeble was the bond that kept them
under restraint.</p>
<div class="figure floatLeft xd21e2870width" id="p133"><img src=

</div>
<p>On the streets of the city are many wayside native restaurants. Here
the employees of the huge tobacco factories come at noon for their
&ldquo;quick lunch&rdquo; or for a refreshing drink. Most of these
establishments are very primitive, and little more than rice, fruit, or
meat is for sale. The charges are the merest pittance. For two cents a
sumptuous meal can be had. It may, therefore, be understood that few
people in Manila go hungry.</p>
<p>The water-girls or the peddlers of milk or cocoa are also worthy of
mention; inasmuch as they, with their rude jars, have a most Oriental
look. One, too, is likely, almost any time, to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>encounter a religious procession, such as The
Feast of the Twelve Apostles, or The Feast of Corpus Christi, when the
companies of friars, in their long robes of black, blue, white, or
brown, alternate with long lines of solemn natives dressed in their
sombre clothes. There are, in fact, forty holidays in the year, and, as
each of these is distinguished by some feast or religious ceremonial,
it can readily be seen how large an influence the Church has upon the
people. The Archbishop is a greater man than the Governor-General, and
as he passes through the streets in his carriage drawn by four white
horses, every head is bared. There are 4,000 priests in Manila
alone.</p>
<p>An execution in Manila is an interesting, though a gruesome, sight.
The populace always flock to see one, and the condemned, with the
stoicism natural to their race, as a rule seem perfectly indifferent to
their fate. The garrote is the instrument usually employed. There is
the pomp and ceremony incident to all Spanish functions of State: a
procession of soldiers, a solemn death-cart, draped in mourning, on
which sits the culprit apparently enjoying his last ride, two or three
priests chanting a dolorous refrain, and the executioner,&mdash;all
slowly approach the place of execution. Here is a raised platform, on
which is a rude seat; against the back of it is an upright post. To
this the condemned is firmly bound, and the deadly brass
collar&mdash;the garrote&mdash;that is attached thereto, closes with a
click around his neck. The executioner now takes his place behind, the
priests elevate the crucifix and continue their chant, while the
victim, half-bewildered, smiles a last farewell or mumbles a hasty
prayer. The commanding officer gives the signal; the executioner gives
a twist to the screw, that just touches the base of the
prisoner&rsquo;s brain; there is a convulsive shiver and a groan, and
all is over. And the spectators, laughing and chattering, turn
homeward.</p>
<p>But no street scene is more interesting than a native funeral. The
hearse is a rude wagon, drawn by white horses. A most
melancholy-looking person is the driver, who, clad in black and a high
beaver hat, sits aloft in mournful dignity. In front is a brass band,
playing a lively march, while a long line of carriages <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>follow slowly behind. On account of the heat,
the burial is nearly always on the same day as the death. The bodies of
the well-to-do are usually deposited in a vault in the church as long
as the relatives of the deceased pay the priests well for the
privilege. When this tribute ceases, the remains are dumped without
ceremony into a huge pit at the back of the church, where perhaps are
the bones of a thousand others. The pit, it is safe to say, is the
ultimate destiny of all.</p>

</div>
<p>There are many drives and promenades in the city of Manila. The
principal one, and the most celebrated, is the Luneta, which is by the
old sea-wall. Here in the cool summer evening is stationed the
Governor&rsquo;s fine military band, and all Manila comes out to see
and to be seen. Thousands of people, natives and foreigners, pair in
careless promenade. Here comes a group of English Jack Tars, from some
British Man-of-War in the harbor. The sailors are flirting vigorously
with a number of bewitching mestiza-girls, just behind. These
olive-cheeked damsels, whose long raven hair, red lips, and pearly
teeth are cunningly displayed in daring coquetry, are all laughing
merrily, smoking betimes a dainty cigarette. Here comes a whole
native-family, trooping along with almost stolid demeanor, yet
listening keenly to the stirring music. And then follow Chinamen, in
their national dress, Englishmen in white drill, and Spaniards in
European costume,&mdash;all walking with the leisurely manner of the
tropics, as if to the climate born. And so thousands pass by,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>bowing and smiling, with never one careworn face
in the vast throng.</p>
<p>Here, too, were enacted some of the most horrible tragedies in the
recent rebellion. Hundreds of native prisoners were here executed. And
such an execution was made occasion of great rejoicing. The fashionable
Spanish element, men and women, was not wanting to witness it; and
while the band discoursed a lively air, the poor fellows were made to
stand on the sea-wall, facing the sea; at a given signal the
firing-squad discharged a volley, and they fell dead or mortally
wounded, while the onlookers cheered for tyranny and Spain.</p>
<p>Though Manila lies very low, it is by no means unhealthy. It is a
pleasant city to live in, but not nearly so pleasant as it might be
made to be. The climate is thus described by an old Spanish proverb:
&ldquo;Six months of dust; six months of mud; six months of
everything.&rdquo; The spring months are December, January, and
February; the climate then is most agreeable. In March, April, and May
the heat is very oppressive. In June, July, August, and September occur
heavy rains. October and November are either wet or dry. The population
of Manila is not far from 300,000, of which 70 per cent. are pure
natives, 15 per cent. Chinese, 14 per cent. mestizo Chinos, and one per
cent. Europeans and Creoles.</p>

<h3 class="main">Iloilo, Capital of the Province of Panay.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the province of Iloilo, in the southern part of the
island of Panay, is the town of Iloilo. It is on the sea, and is built
on a low, marshy plain. Iloilo is the capital of the province in which
it is situated, and it is also one of the principal sea-ports of the
colony. The harbor is excellent, being well-protected by the island of
Guimaras, which lies just beyond. This island is much higher than the
mainland, with which it forms a kind of funnel, so that there is a
constant breeze, which makes Iloilo much cooler and healthier than
Manila. During the spring-tides the whole town is covered with
water.</p>
<p>Iloilo is a manufacturing town. Its principal product is
pi&ntilde;a, a fine cloth made from the fibre of the pineapple-leaf.
Jusi&mdash;another fabric made from silk and woven into various
colors&mdash;is also manufactured here.</p>
<p>The country around the town is very fertile, and is extensively
cultivated. The facilities for transportation to and from the interior
of the island are very poor. This, of course, is a great bar to the
development of the commerce. However, over 1,000,000 piculs of sugar
are raised around Iloilo; also a great amount of tobacco; much rice,
too, is raised here. The town is doubtless destined to become a great
commercial centre. It is about 250 miles from Manila. Typhoons are not
uncommon, though <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139"
name="pb139">139</a>]</span>earthquakes are infrequent. Most of the
traders are Chinese Mestizos. Some of them are very wealthy.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e2931width" id="p139"><img src="images/p139.jpg"
alt="At the Port of Iloilo" width="701" height="589">
<p class="figureHead">At the Port of Iloilo</p>
</div>
<p>The port of Iloilo is of recent date, its opening being wholly due
to foreigners. The produce shipped from there comes mostly in American
sailing vessels to the United States. Iloilo has become the shipping
centre for the crops of sugar and sapan-wood of the islands of Negros
and Panay, and the opening up of this port has greatly encouraged
agriculture in the Visayas district. Manila is too far away. The Iloilo
district includes the large islands of Panay, Negros, Ceb&uacute;, and
others, and has a second port of rising importance, Ceb&uacute;, on the
island of that name.</p>
<p>Cavit&eacute; is a fortified town, on a small peninsula, in the bay
of Manila, about ten miles from the capital. To it a steamboat runs
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>twice daily. The Government arsenal and the only
shipyard in the colony are located here, and it is, therefore, the
chief naval station in the islands. Cavit&eacute; is also the residence
of most of the Spanish naval officers and of many foreigners: their
handsome bungalows are on the outskirts of the town. Some fine shops, a
theatre, a few caf&eacute;s, and the old Cathedral are the most
noteworthy objects of interest in the town itself. The Cathedral is
large and imposing, and its architecture is characteristic of most of
the churches of the colony. The houses in Cavit&eacute; were formerly
of wood, but since a fire, in 1754, which destroyed the town, most of
them are built of stone or brick. But even this did not save the town;
for the earthquake of 1880 again laid it waste.</p>

<p>Cavit&eacute; was taken by the British in 1763, and has always been
deemed the key to the capital. It was the seat of the rebellion of
1872, when the rebels seized and plundered the arsenal. This
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=

leaders executed or deported. Cavit&eacute;, on account of its
strategic value, was the first place taken by Admiral Dewey after the
battle. As elsewhere described, it then became the headquarters for
Aguinaldo and the insurgents. Under a humane and an advanced government
of the islands, Cavit&eacute; should become a large city.</p>
<p>Majajay is a picturesque mountain-town, in Luzon; it contains
several fine streets and many charming residences. The church and the
convent are striking; the scenery in the vicinity is magnificent. The
waterfall of Bot&oacute;can is well worth a visit. It is about 600 feet
high, and 60 feet wide. The view is impressive.</p>
<p>L&uacute;gbang, near Majajay, is a thousand feet higher. Around it
are extensive rice-fields. In the town are several fine canals, some
good streets, and many commodious residences. A stone church and a
convent front the little plaza. On the other side is the Tribunal, an
imposing government building.</p>
<p>Tayabas is the capital of Tayabas province. In some of the streets
are canals. Besides the houses of the wealthy planters, there are the
usual church and convent. In the vicinity of Tayabas are extensive
timber-yards.</p>
<p>Laguimanoc, a small town on the coast of Luzon, is also a port. The
mail steamers stop there. The chief trade is in building-timber; for
around the town are magnificent forests. The harbor is an excellent
one, and, with increase of trade, the place should have a great
future.</p>
<p>Lipa is the capital of the Batangas province, Luzon. It is a centre
of the coffee-trade. Besides, the temperature there is cooler than that
of most of the Philippine towns. It is noted for its large church and
its convent&mdash;among the most remarkable in the colony. Most of the
houses are three stories high, and many wealthy planters live in the
vicinity.</p>
<p>Taal is one of the principal towns of Luzon. It is situated on a
hill upon the left bank of the Pansipit river. On the opposite side is
the town of Lemeri. A bridge connects the two.</p>
<p>Taal was formerly on the shore of the Lake of Taal, near the
volcano, but the old town was destroyed by the earthquake of 1754.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>The new town is hilly, and is surrounded by
sugar-cane plantations and great forests. The streets are lined with
modern shops and spacious residences. Many of the inhabitants are of
Japanese origin; but the Chinese, strange to say, are not tolerated. As
there is considerable trade in sugar, in coffee, and cotton stuffs,
trading-steamers ply between Taal and Manila. The population of the
town and its suburbs is about 50,000.</p>

<p>Batangas, another town in Luzon, is the capital of the province of
that name. It is near the sea, and is the residence of the Governor and
the other chief officials of the province. There is a beautiful park in
the centre of the town, and a fine drive, where the European residents
are wont to meet. In and around the town are many pretty bungalows and
some large sugar-factories.</p>
<p>Santa Cruz de Malabon is a town in the rice-district of Luzon. It is
a charming little place, and some wealthy natives live there. Near the
town are several water-power rice-husking mills, that give <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>employment to hundreds of natives. The country
all around is low and flat, but not lacking in beauty.</p>
<p>Silan is also in Luzon, and is a good-sized town. It is noted for
its religious feasts and fairs. The church and the convent are
celebrated, and are among the handsomest in the colony.</p>
<p>Carmona, Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as, and Vi&ntilde;an, are flourishing
towns in the vicinity of Silan. All are well worthy of a visit.</p>
<p>At the foot of the Maquiling mountain is Calamba, a market-town.
Nearly all the land thereabouts is owned by the Dominicans, who rent it
to the native rice and sugar-planters.</p>
<p>Below the Maquiling mountain, which is a crater, are hot springs.
Near them is the town of Los Ba&ntilde;os, or the Baths. These springs
are beneficial in curing rheumatism and other ills. A hospital,
therefore, has been erected there, which is dedicated to our Lady of
the Holy Waters.</p>
<div class="figure floatRight xd21e2988width" id="p144"><img src=

<p class="figureHead">A Milkwoman of Calamba.</p>
</div>
<p>Other objects of interest are a vapor bath-house and the remains of
several large public buildings. Los Ba&ntilde;os was once a popular
resort, and was under the administration of the Franciscans. The
Government, however, desiring a share of the profits, gradually, by
onerous exactions, caused the ruin of the place. If some enterprising
American would get hold of it, Los Ba&ntilde;os could be made a great
resort.</p>
<p>A few miles from Los Ba&ntilde;os, on the Malanin river, about 1200
feet above the sea, is the boiling lake of Natungos. This, too,
possesses wonderful medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Santa Cruz is the capital of the Laguna province. It is a
market-town of considerable size and importance, and contains a fine
church and one or two impressive government buildings. The principal
street is also called the Escolta. Santa Cruz is the centre of the
cocoanut trade, and is a meeting-place for stock-dealers.</p>
<p>Pagsanjan, a small old town near Santa Cruz, contains some elegant
residences. It has, however, an air of fallen grandeur. And well it
may! for it was once an important place. Around it are extensive
forests of cocoanut palms.</p>
<p>Puerta is on Pala&uacute;an Island, and has an excellent harbor.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>Near it is a lighthouse and a naval station. It
is a penal settlement, and is surrounded by large sugar-estates, worked
by the convicts. The town is pretty, and the suburbs are
delightful.</p>
<p>The principal port of Mindanao is Zamboanga, a small but interesting
town. Sulu is the principal port of Sulu, and is the centre of the
pearl trade.</p>
<p>The capital of Negros is Bac&oacute;lod. It contains, besides a
church and a government house, some handsome residences belonging to
the chief traders and to the government officials. The town is on the
coast, but, as the water is very shallow, steamers are obliged to
anchor a half-mile from the shore. Bac&oacute;lod is a good field for
investors, as it is in the very heart of the sugar and rice-district of
Negros, and its trade is constantly growing.</p>

Ceb&uacute;, and ranks next to Iloilo among the ports of the
Philippines. The town is well-constructed, and is surrounded by fine
roads. The people are conservative, and lack thrift and enterprise. The
principal exports are hemp and sugar, most of which comes from the
large plantations of the neighboring islands of Leyte, Camaguin, and

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Philippines, with the Sulu Protectorate, number
about 600 habitable islands, that lie all the way from 4&deg; 45&prime;
to 21&deg; N. latitude.</p>
<p>The area of the eleven largest islands is variously computed to be
somewhere between 55,000 and 150,000 square miles. It is probably not
far from the latter sum. All the islands together are about as large as
the combined area of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, and
Delaware.</p>
<p>The eleven largest islands are: Luzon, Mindanao, S&aacute;mar,
Panay, Negros, Pala&uacute;an, Mindoro, Leyte, Ceb&uacute;, Masbate,
and Bojol. Luzon and Mindanao are probably as large as all the others
combined.</p>
<p>All the islands are mountainous and of volcanic formation.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the principal peaks:</p>

<p>In the interior of the islands are magnificent forests of stately
trees, splendid with luxuriant foliage and the glorious flora of the
tropics. Here are gigantic creepers and gorgeous festoons,&mdash;the
splendid parasites of this opulent clime. Luscious fruits in rich
clusters hang from pendent boughs of myriad trees, inviting the
passer-by to pluck.</p>
<p>One that has never seen it, can form no idea of the splendor of such
a tropical forest&mdash;teeming with all that is brilliant and grand in
nature. It would seem as if the Creator had emptied the cornucopia of
his gifts over this garden-spot of the world, making it a veritable
Eden.</p>
<p>There are many rivers throughout the islands,&mdash;some navigable.
The Pasig river, in Luzon, empties into Manila Bay. Vessels drawing
thirteen feet of water enter the Pasig river. In the same island, the
Rio Grande de Cagayan is also navigable and runs through the Cagayan
valley northward. It yearly overflows its banks. On them are the
richest tobacco-districts in the colony. The Rio Grande de la Pampanga
flows southward through the glorious valley of Pampanga, emptying by
twenty mouths into Manila Bay. On the banks of this river are extensive
rice-fields and sugar-cane plantations, and great forests; among them
gleam numerous towns and villages, full of a thriving population. The
Rio Agno, which flows southward, past the port of Dagupan and the Bicol
river&mdash;which flows from Bato lake to the bay of San
Miguel&mdash;is also in Luzon, and navigable.</p>
<p>In Mindanao, the Rio Agusan cuts the island almost in two. It is
navigable only a few miles. In Negros Island, the Danao is navigable.

<p>The Bay lake (Luzon)&mdash;Laguna de Bay,&mdash;is 25 miles long and
12 miles broad. It is higher than Manila, and its overflow is the Pasig
river.</p>
<p>In the centre of Bombon lake is an active volcano called Taal, which
is no less famed in the history of the colony than is Vesuvius in the
history of Naples. It has had many celebrated eruptions, some very
destructive. In 1754 several towns were overwhelmed by a flood of
burning lava, which was thrown as far as fifteen miles from the crater,
causing great damage, even at that distance. It is said that cinders
fell in Manila, 34 miles away. There was a smell of sulphur in the air
for months; the lake was full of dead fish; and the earth, for miles,
was heaped with burning lava and ashes. This eruption lasted nearly six
months. The town of Taal was entirely destroyed, and most of the
inhabitants perished. On that day darkness hung over the whole sky, and
the air was full of cries and lamentations. It seemed as if the end of
the world had come.</p>
<p>The Mayon volcano, in Albay, has also had several destructive
eruptions. Its crest is always fiery. In 1814, 2,500 natives were
killed and wounded. During the last eruption, in 1888, fifteen lives
were lost, and many cattle.</p>
<p>Near the volcano of Mayon are the sulphur springs of Albay, noted
for their wonderful medicinal properties. Here, no doubt, some
enterprising American will soon build a resort, or a sanitarium. And a
most splendid location indeed it would be!</p>
<p>Though in the heart of the tropics, the Philippines are by no means
unhealthy. The year is divided into the wet and the dry monsoons; the
west coast being dry, the eastern coast wet, and <i>vice-versa</i>. The
annual rainfall is about 90 inches. Mosquitoes and white ants are the
most troublesome pests. Terrific tornados are common, and earthquakes
are as plentiful as blackberries in an Alabama cemetery. In 1875 a
typhoon destroyed 4000 houses and killed about 300 people. In 1863 an
earthquake destroyed the greater part of Manila&mdash;3000 people were
killed and injured. The earthquake of 1880 was also very destructive.

<p>That of &rsquo;63 occurred at night, and I remember it well. I was
then a little boy, but the horrors of that night I can never forget.
The earth trembled and seemed to rise and fall; huge fissures opened in
the ground, and dull rumblings were heard everywhere, while the shrieks
of tens of thousands arose on every hand. Many were buried in the ruins
of their houses.</p>
<p>For weeks afterward, the people slept in the streets; for the
greater part of the city was destroyed.</p>
<p>The earthquake of 1880 occurred while the people were at tiffin, or
lunch. Hence the number of casualties was not so great; for most of the
people were able to leave their houses before they were shaken
down.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The preceding chapters give but a faint idea of the
great wealth of plant-life in the Philippine Islands, of the richness
and abundance of the fruits, the variety and usefulness of the trees,
the multitude of growths that add to the comfort and convenience of
human life. Yet, after all is said, every description of the plant-life
there gives but an inadequate idea of the real luxuriance and beauty of
the group, and its value from a botanical point of view. These rich and
multitudinous islands, seated in the midst of a tropical sea, form, in
reality, a botanist&rsquo;s paradise, a region in which an ardent
naturalist might browse for years, and still have new treasures to
find.</p>
<p>I am no scientist. Indeed, I have often wished I were, when
journeying through these lush tropical forests with their interminable
variety of forms of plant-life; many of them of the greatest beauty,
some odd and bizarre in appearance, numbers of them unknown to science;
the whole presenting the appearance of a virgin wilderness, keeping its
treasures intact for the one that can appreciate them. The Spaniard
looks upon nature with a lazy eye, troubling himself little about
anything that cannot be put to some immediate use. And he has jealously
guarded the islands against alien footsteps, putting annoying obstacles
in the way of all that sought to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152"
href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>explore their interior. In
consequence, the Philippines may be said to be in a large measure
unexplored, waiting for the botanist to discover their treasures, the
poet to sing their beauties, the practical man to develop their
resources.</p>
<p>Energy and enterprise are sadly needed, and it will require the
go-ahead American spirit to bring about the possibilities of those
fertile tropical lands.</p>

<p class="first">And the earth possesses no scenes more beautiful than
those to be found in this verdant and blooming Archipelago,&mdash;from
its northern to its southern verge, this magnificent rosary of glowing
islands, that Nature has hung above the heaving bosom of the warm
Pacific. Of them all, none is more beautiful than Luzon. <span class=

largest and the richest of the whole, with its vast variety of
attractive scenery, mountain and plain, lake and stream, everywhere
rich with glossy leafage, clustered growths of bamboo and palm, fields
of yellow cane, and verdant coffee-groves. Everywhere is wealth of
trees, clothing the mountains to their summits, and bordering the long
green miles of ocean-shore.</p>
<p>On a smaller scale, but not less beautiful than lordly Luzon, are
the many minor islands, such as Panay, Negros, Ceb&uacute;,
S&aacute;mar, and others of names that would be strange to foreign
ears. Here there are no stretches of barren lands, no drought-stricken
shores, as in some of the isles of the West, no flat and chalky fields
like those of Barbadoes; and even the loveliest of the Antilles must
yield the palm of beauty to these charming isles of the eastern ocean.
Here an abundant rainfall, an equable climate, a rich soil, and the
warm influences of the equatorial waters combine to yield a luxuriant
beauty and variety of scenery that must be observed to be
appreciated.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Magnificence of Tropical Scenery.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Tropical scenery cannot be pictured in words. It must
be seen to be comprehended. One need not, too, go beyond the environs
of Manila&mdash;that Venice of the East, with its labyrinth of canals
and estuaries,&mdash;through which the tides of the broad bay daily ebb
and flow,&mdash;and with its wealth of brilliant flowers and tropic
verdure&mdash;to imagine oneself in a new world. Its surroundings are a
dream of beauty.</p>
<p>Take any of the roads that run outward from the city. Say, starting
from the Malecon promenade: one passes through stretches of country
verdant with groves of graceful bamboos, lofty cocoanut palms,
flowing-leaved plantains, and all the wonderful variety and luxuriance
of tropical vegetation. Upon it the eye gazes unsated, the leaves and
flowers alike being rich and gorgeous in tint and form. Often have I
wandered, entranced, up the eddying Pasig, enraptured by the beauty of
its scenery and the charm of its coloring, viewing, also from its leafy
banks <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>the splendors of sunset skies, grand and glowing
to a degree seldom seen in temperate zones.</p>

alt="Malecon Promenade, Along Manila Bay." width="695" height="423">
<p class="figureHead">Malecon Promenade, Along Manila Bay.</p>
</div>
<p>Further inland the mountain scenery never fails to charm, with the
varied pictures presented by its forest-growth. A grotesqueness of form
is often assumed by the trunks and limbs of tropical trees, and this,
with the glossy green foliage, the rich hues and attractive shapes of
the blossoms, the novel forms and colors of the fruits, the dash and
sparkle of mountain streams, here and there breaking into lovely
cascades, all co-ordinated to the eye, compose a spectacle of beauty
seldom excelled.</p>
<p>Of all those plants, the tall and graceful bamboo ranks among the
most beautiful. Everywhere it is found, growing in groups and clusters,
scattered with great profusion and variety over hill and plain, along
the streams, and around the native huts and villages. At the slightest
breeze its fleecy tops and supple branches wave gracefully in the air,
giving to the foliage the charm of perpetual motion. In addition, too,
to its almost endless variety of uses, it has a mission beyond that of
utility,&mdash;the mission of beauty, and it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>may
justly be viewed as one of the choicest decorations of the island
scenery.</p>
<p>The bamboo never grows monotonous. It presents forms and colors of
wonderful attractiveness and variety, and so fully dealt with has it
been by the brush of the painter and the pen of the poet, that it might
well be given a fine-art gallery and a library of its own.</p>
<p>In the depths of the forest, and along the streams, beautiful
orchids abound; here clustered on stately trees so dense of growth that
the sun&rsquo;s rays scarcely penetrate their foliage; there giving
life and color to the ground, and of such odd and amazing forms, that
one often seems looking rather upon flowering birds and insects than
upon plants. Here and there one finds oneself amid the spreading roots
of the balete tree (Ficus Indica), from whose broad buttresses rises
the mighty trunk, of such girth and even rotundity, that the natives
make cart-wheels from sections of it. Down from the boughs, sixty feet
in air, hang the rope-like lianes, descending, like nature&rsquo;s
cordage, to the ground, while to the limbs cling orchids and other
foreign growths, until the entire great tree seems a botanical world in
itself.</p>
<p>I have passed hours wandering spellbound in the forest, or gazing
with eyes of wonder and delight into its silent depths. Yes, little of
the poet as I have in my make-up, I, too, have been taken prisoner by a
beauty and a grandeur that I found it difficult to tear myself away
from.</p>
<p>And these scenes are not merely local. Indeed, wherever one goes
into the rural regions of the islands he finds the same amazing
prodigality of tropic growth. There are thousands of square miles of
dense forest within which the foot of the white man has rarely ever
set; thousands perhaps upon which none but the natives have ever gazed;
costly woods, whose value can be reckoned only in millions of dollars.
Valuable herbs, medicinal plants, and hot springs abound; and the
naturalist and the economic botanist alike are sadly needed to open up
this luxuriant land to the world. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156"

<h3 class="main">The Promise of the Future.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Under new control I expect to see, in the twentieth
century, a new destiny for this noble group of islands. Whether the
people be given their freedom under the protection and influence of the
United States, or the islands become a direct appanage of that or of
some other enterprising nation of the West, a turn in the tide of
Philippine affairs can hardly fail to set in, and the possibilities of
the land be developed to an extent undreamed of under the effete rule
of Spain.</p>
<p>I expect to see an invasion of this island-realm by three classes of
modern enterprise. The scientist is sure to find his way there, and
tell the world of the new and the strange in the animal, vegetable, and
mineral kingdoms. With him will come the engineer, opening up roads
right and left, laying a network of iron rails, where now only the
buffalo-cart drags along, introducing the latest machinery for mining
and farming-industries, and starting a hum of activity in every quarter
of the long-slumbering land. With these also will enter the practical
economist, in search, not of the new, but of the useful, prospecting
the forests for plants of economic value, seeking for new mines of coal
and iron, tracing the gold placer-beds up to their mother-veins,
seeking everywhere for what the Philippines have to add to the useful
productions of the world.</p>
<p>These will be the twentieth century pioneers of this promising
Archipelago, the results of their labors being exploited by the
merchant and the manufacturer. The seas shall teem with ships carrying
the products of the islands to foreign shores, and bringing back full
cargoes to supply the demands of the islanders, commerce steadily
growing in amount as civilization awakens the natives to the perception
of new wants.</p>
<p>Examples of a similar rejuvenation could easily be pointed out, and
there is no conceivable reason why the Philippines should not be added
to the list. These islands have been lavishly dealt with by nature;
they have an industrious population; yet they have been allowed to
remain for centuries in a semi-savage industrial condition; they still
await the touch of the magic hand of modern enterprise to arouse them
from their state of decadence, and swing them into the tide of human
progress. Under this influence prosperity <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb157" href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>and activity must
come to them, as it has come to other lands, and those long-neglected
and abused islands be made to &ldquo;bud and blossom like the
rose.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure floatLeft xd21e3232width" id="p157"><img src=

<p class="figureHead">A Mestiza Flower-girl.</p>
</div>
<p>Certainty of conviction and opinion, too, leads me to affirm that,
with sanitary arrangements in all the cities, with hygienic living, and
American enterprise, philanthropy, and valor in the islands, and free
educational facilities eventually,&mdash;all will manifestly increase
the <i>morale</i> of the islanders and develop a just appreciation of
the natural beauties of their bounteous realm; hence, what is now
confusedly enjoyed and but vaguely beheld in nature, will, in a
comparatively brief period, become simple, clear, sympathetic, and
clearly formulated to their apprehension.</p>
<p>And all this, as well as many other allied benefits co-existent with
a permanent American occupation, will come with personal education,
personal elevation; and without lessening the labor-producing quality
of the native, or the outward physical radiation that constitutes his
health and vigor. Health, like knowledge, will come to him in
ever-widening circles, and Nature, in full festival&mdash;as she is
during the greater part of the Philippine year&mdash;will also appeal
to him as she has never appealed before.</p>
<p>All this may be hazardous prophecy; it may appear optimistic,
&aelig;sthetic, and fanciful, but I have talked with many rude
untutored natives, that, frankly, astonished me with the unwitting
revelation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>of latent poetry, love of imagery, and spiritual
longings in their nature.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, and also the adaptability of the cultured native,
hence the rosy view of the possible development of the Philippine
Islands&rsquo; native population.</p>
<p>The vivid contrasts, the checkered scenery, and the pulchritudinous
beauty of the islands would ravish the soul of the impressionistic
painter, and inspire his brush to masterpieces. There forest and plain,
sky and sea, unroll in unexpected beauty or marvelous grandeur at every
turn; until, after visiting the interior or skirting the shores of many
islands, one has a kind of kaleidoscopic memory, yet none the less
brilliant, perfectly formed, and orderly&mdash;each in harmonious
sequence&mdash;of long lines of shadowy hills, majestic
mountain-ranges, with forest-clad slopes verging toward the sea; pretty
rambling creeks and gurgling rivulets<span class="corr" id="xd21e3251"
title="Not in source">,</span> cliff-bound coasts, cultivated plain and
rugged hill; here and there shaded dells with mountain torrents
roaring, unseen; a glorious sunset, or a splendid sunrise present in
the memory-pictures of mountain, sea, and plain.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Morning Ceremonies.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Nothing in the life of the people of the Philippine
Islands is more interesting to the foreigner than the village feasts;
nothing is more indicative of the character of the people, who are
exceedingly fond of ornament and display. Every village has its own
feasts, to which all the natives in the surrounding district
contribute;&mdash;in which all alike take part.</p>
<p>These feasts are always of a religious character, and are encouraged
by the clergy, who find them not only lucrative, but also conducive to
religious feeling.</p>
<p>Come with me and visit the busy morning-scene of a fiesta in a
populous village near the capital. As we enter the broad roadway,
winding with serpentine folds among the gleaming bungalows, we see
everywhere signs of unusual activity; groups of smiling natives,
dressed in their Sunday best, hurry by, chattering gaily. Here comes a
long line of carromatas (small carts) drawn by wiry ponies, driven by
well-to-do native planters: with the lofty consciousness of worldly
prosperity they sit erect in imperturbable dignity.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e3274width" id="p160"><img src="images/p160.jpg"
alt="A Village Feast." width="720" height="457">
<p class="figureHead">A Village Feast.</p>
</div>
<p>We join a passing group and follow them past the low, airy houses,
all decorated now with gorgeous bunting and gay festoons. Flags and
streamers flutter on every house-top; the whole village <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>presents a scene of picturesque animation; for
the tropical luxuriance of the trees and the myriad flowers of gorgeous
hue, form a brilliant background.</p>
<p>We arrive at the village-green, and here stands a motley assemblage,
constantly reinforced by the throngs that come in by every path and
roadway. An expression of eager anticipation is on the faces of all as
they gaze in the direction of the little church that fronts the crowded
court. The church is a low, massive, white building, with large pillars
in front, that give it a semi-classic appearance; it forms a curious,
but not uninteresting, contrast to the many-gabled bungalows.</p>
<p>The bells in the campanile begin to toll slowly, and from the midst
of the crowd instantly comes a burst of glorious music. The
village-band stationed there renders effectively an operatic air as the
natives slowly enter the church. After all are seated, the priest
preaches a short sermon, full of pith and of pertinent suggestion about
the Saint whom the day commemorates. The audience is then dismissed
with a benediction; and to the lively music of some composer it files
leisurely out. The natives see nothing incongruous in the introduction
of operatic music into divine worship. They are moved to devotion no
less by the stirring strains of one of Sousa&rsquo;s military marches
or a languorous waltz of Strauss, than by the solemn <i>Te Deums</i> of
the Catholic ritual. To them all music is divine.</p>
<p>We stop a few minutes to watch the cura,&mdash;the parish
priest,&mdash;as he dispenses blessings to his devout parishioners, who
now crowd round him with every appearance of reverential affection.</p>
<p>Our friend the cura is a veritable father to his people. As he
listens to the ingenuous confidences of his flock, his face beams with
that rare benevolence born of godliness; there is a whisper of domestic
sorrow that he needs must hear, a story of happiness or a tale of
wrong. For each and all he has a word of kindly affection, and as he
sees us waiting near the entrance, he approaches with outstretched hand
and invites us to the grand procession in the evening.</p>

</div>
<p>The people have dispersed, and have returned to their homes.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>Already the sun is high in the sky, pouring a
deluge of heat upon the landscape. From the horizon, mountain after
mountain springs airily into the heavens, their blue peaks suggesting a
place of perpetual coolness, upon which the eye loves to linger amid
the oppressive blaze of the tropic sun.</p>
<p>Surrounding the village are forests of majestic trees, of
indescribable grandeur, and of unparalleled magnificence. Among these
the white houses of the planters nestle peacefully.</p>
<p>Each house has its own tiny garden, fenced in with reeds, and forms
a miniature paradise, where are flowers of splendid hue, creepers with
purple blossoms, red-coral blooms, and trees of palm, mango, orange,
lanzon, santol, and giant bananas, whose rich fruits, in giant
clusters, tempt the eye of the beholder. Here the native is a petty
king: for his own little domain, for nine months of the year, yields
sufficient for his wants. Nature, indeed, gives him a golden harvest
for only the reaping.</p>
<p>We have been invited to spend the day with a well-to-do native
planter, who, at the conclusion of the service, has sought us out. He
lives on the outskirts of the village, and we are soon with him in his
carromata, speeding leisurely over the highway.</p>
<p>We approach his home&mdash;a typical native dwelling; the body of
the house is raised about six feet from the ground, and is mounted on
thick pieces of stone. This allows the air to circulate freely beneath,
and prevents the entrance of snakes and insects, and is in every way
conducive to health and comfort. We mount the wide stairway, that
connects the house with the ground, and enter upon a broad open piazza
facing the street, called a cahida. The sides of this are formed of
sliding windows, composed of small square panes of mother-of-pearl,
opaque to the heat, but admitting the rays of light. Here we are
introduced to the various members of the family, who receive us kindly
and offer sugared dainties and a cigarette.</p>

alt="Home of a Well-to-do Manila Merchant." width="720" height="453">
<p class="figureHead">Home of a Well-to-do Manila Merchant.</p>
</div>
<p>Beyond is a large room, with walls of window and with sliding doors.
Here are some chairs and a table, covered with a handsomely embroidered
cloth. Upon the walls, which are covered with cloth instead of plaster,
are various bric-a-brac, artistically <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb165" href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>arranged upon
scrolls; while several engravings of religious subjects and one or two
family portraits hang between. From the centre of the ceiling hangs a
crystal chandelier with globes of colored glass; a small oratory,
supporting the brazen image of some Saint, stands in the corner. The
broad floor-planks, daily scrubbed and polished with <span class="corr"
id="xd21e3320" title="Source: plaintain">plantain</span> leaves, are as
smooth and clean as a mirror.</p>
<p>Opening from this main room are several smaller rooms, used as
bedrooms. A narrow passage-way leads to the bath-room and to the
kitchen&mdash;in a separate building. The design of the whole domicile
seems to aim at cleanliness and coolness,&mdash;both essentials of
comfort in this hot, moist climate.</p>
<p>The roof is patched with nipa palm, and the outside walls of
bamboo&mdash;painted white and striped with green and blue&mdash;are
covered with grotesque carvings. This, with the broad eaves and the
wide balconies, gives the house a most picturesque appearance.</p>
<p>We note with gratification the many signs of family affection around
us. The father, kind and considerate; the mother, sweet and
sympathetic; the children, quiet, obedient, and well-behaved&mdash;a
picture of domestic happiness that is representative rather than
exceptional.</p>

<h3 class="main">How the Afternoon is Spent.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After tiffin, each retires to his own room to enjoy
the siesta; and thus we sleep soundly through the heavy afternoon
hours.</p>
<p>The siesta over, we venture into the village. Through the streets
are hurrying scores of men, nearly every one with a cock under his arm.
They are going to the cock-pit. We follow, and soon we come to our
destination.</p>
<p>Imagine a large bamboo building with a thatched roof, wherein
hundreds of natives have gathered, for, what is to them, the supreme
enjoyment of life. Around the door are one or two guards in Spanish
uniform; but everything appears so decorous and orderly that it is
indeed difficult to realize that we are in a gigantic gambling den.
Nearly every native has with him his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb166" href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>fighting-cock, which
he loves as devotedly as one of his own children, and upon which he has
spent much care and interest. The &ldquo;farmer,&rdquo; often a
Chinaman, who has secured a license from the Government to run the
cock-pit, stands in the middle of the ring, around him a group of
natives excited and eager.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e3341width" id="p166"><img src="images/p166.jpg"
alt="Cock-fighting: the Supreme Enjoyment." width="663" height="479">
<p class="figureHead">Cock-fighting: the Supreme Enjoyment.</p>
</div>
<p>Two fighting-cocks, each armed with a steel spur three or four
inches long, are in the hands of their respective owners. Every eye is
riveted upon the prospective contestants. The farmer, or proprietor,
announces that the contest is about to begin, and from every hand
dollars rain into the ring, each person staking a certain amount upon
his favorite.</p>
<p>This done, all is breathless expectation, and at the word
&ldquo;<i>Casada</i>&rdquo; (meaning matched), and at
&ldquo;<i>Largo</i>&rdquo; (let go), the fowls are let loose.</p>
<p>The fight waxes hot and furious; the two cocks are as pugnacious as
bull-pups. But it is soon over; for, at a well-directed thrust from the
steel spur, one of the contestants lies dead. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span></p>
<p>The crier now announces the name of the winner, and all the winners
come down into the middle of the ring and pick up their own stakes, as
well as the amount won by the wager.</p>
<p>Strangers often remark how unusual it is that amid so much
confusion, and where there is apparently boundless opportunity for
cheating, there should be so much honesty and good faith.</p>
<p>However, every man is to be trusted. I have never known but one
exception&mdash;he was instantly hacked to pieces with knives. There
are over a hundred of these gambling pits around Manila. It is the
natives&rsquo; greatest diversion. Opposition to this sport would
almost create a rebellion; and so the Spanish Government wisely makes
the best of it, pocketing almost a million dollars a year from the
licenses.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Evening Procession.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is night. Against the sombre gloom of the heavens
twinkle millions of stars: they too are a part of the grand
illumination that is to be the climax of the whole fiesta. Again the
village-green in front of the church! It is alive with the happy
villagers, decked in all their finery&mdash;the men and boys in airy,
colored shirts and white trousers, the women and girls in splendid
skirts and brilliant chemisettes.</p>
<p>All are standing bareheaded. The band is discoursing sweet music,
and the people stand entranced. Not a sound is heard till the tune is
ended; then, on every hand, arises a decorous murmur of delight. Here
comes the cura. He at once proceeds to arrange the procession, which is
the event of the feast, and to which the villagers have been looking
forward, with joyous anticipation, for many months. Mysterious groups
are issuing from the church. These are assigned to their respective
positions by the father, who, in this, as in all else, is the master of
ceremonies. Let us, however, leave the crowd and move a little way up
the street, where, before long, the procession is to pass.</p>
<p>Over the roadway, from airy arches, gaily decorated with bunting,
are suspended Chinese lanterns. On the gateways to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>houses, on all the fences that line the street,
hang little fat-pots, whose pale flicker, multiplied a thousand-fold,
produces a most romantic effect, to which the lights on the arches and
the many-colored illuminated lamps in the windows add a subdued
splendor.</p>
<p>We have not long to wait; for the procession has been speedily
arranged, and is already making its way up the street, the band, at the
head, playing an operatic air.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e3378width" id="p168"><img src="images/p168.jpg"

<p class="figureHead">Interior of the Cathedral, Where All Processions
Begin and End.</p>
</div>
<p>Behind come the happy participants, two by two; men and women
alternating. All carry torches, whose glow throws over their grave
faces a gleam of soft light, that harmonizes well with the nature of
the occasion.</p>
<p>And now comes the spangled image of some old Saint borne aloft on a
litter; while a murmur of applause bursts from the admiring onlookers.
From every house rockets are shot into the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>heavens, showering on the dusky night
constellations of colored stars.</p>
<p>Thus, Saint after Saint, martyr after martyr, is majestically borne
along, till near the end of the procession appears the image of the
Virgin, herself &ldquo;decked with jewels bright and with glory
crowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the murmur rises to a shout of devout acclaim: the Queen of the
festive night, Our Lady, passes on.</p>
<p>Thus, through every street, winds the brilliant procession under the
lighted arches, returning finally to the village-court, whence it
started. Here the priest pronounces a benediction, and with a clash of
triumphant music the participants are dismissed.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Entertainment at Home.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Again we accompany our host back to his hospitable
mansion, where a generous meal has been prepared for us. We partake
heartily of the good things: roast-pig, chicken, many kinds of native
fruits, and rice. At the close, cigarettes are passed round,&mdash;both
men and women smoking,&mdash;and we soon enter into conversation while
the newer arrivals are being served.</p>
<p>It is our host&rsquo;s grand reception night. A hundred guests have
partaken of his bounty, and the veranda and the sitting-room are
crowded with friends and neighbors,&mdash;invited and uninvited; all
are equally welcome. Cigars and cigarettes are passed round, and now
the fun begins. A girl&mdash;a wonderfully sweet and pretty
creature&mdash;with glowing black eyes and long, loose black
hair&mdash;advances to the centre of the room, and croons a low,
plaintive air, reminiscent of unrequited love. She accompanies her
music with a weird dance, impressive through its very simplicity.
Gradually her tones grow louder and her movements quicker, signifying
all the varying degrees of advance and refusal. Her supple body glides
into a thousand graceful curves, each eloquent of beauty. Her pale
olive face becomes mantled with a rich crimson tide as she lashes
herself into a fury of passion. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170"
href="#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>She feigns anger, and,
stamping her pretty feet, now in petulant disdain, now in a paroxysm of
wrath, stands the incarnation of beautiful rage. It is a picture full
of tragic power, of deep significance.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e3404width" id="p170"><img src="images/p170.jpg"

</div>
<p>She is approaching the climax of her passion. Her voice is sharp and
shrill as it trembles with scorn or defiance. Forward and backward her
body sways with a rhythmic swing that compels the attention of every
beholder. Many, in fact, accompany her every motion with the
sympathetic movement of unconscious imitation: their faces mirror the
feelings of the dancer.</p>
<p>And now a note of triumph rings out, and the singer&rsquo;s face
glows with an expression of ecstasy; while, bounding forward, her
splendid hair trailing its waves of ebony, she seems
transformed,&mdash;the apotheosis of joy. Then slowly decreasing in
volume, her voice sinks to a low whisper of serene content, and,
blushing modestly at the applause, she retires to give place to
others.</p>
<p>Two young men and a girl now come forward, and a scene of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>desperate rivalry on the part of the men, and of
tantalizing coquetry on the part of the maiden, is enacted. This is by
means of a series of intricate dance-movements, no less striking than
original. A pretty tableau truly! And one not lacking in sentiment and
in spontaneous expression. A foreigner would believe that these lithe
young natives were in terrible earnest, and that they were rehearsing a
passion of the heart! Such, indeed, is often the case, and many a girl
has, through the license of this dance, shown her preference. Many a
youth, too, has seen his hopes blasted, and his rival exalted, by a
dainty pirouette.</p>
<p>This dance is followed by another, in which an exquisite girl and a
fat young man take part. It is an Oriental rhapsody; a sort of
couchee-couchee,&mdash;very suggestive and voluptuous, according to
Western ideas. There are wrigglings and writhings, and clasps and
embraces; all the sweet contortions of secret love, that the natives
take as a matter of course, just as Europeans regard the waltz.</p>
<p>Dance after dance follows, and it is getting late. But another
entertainment is in store for us; and so once more we venture forth
into the night&mdash;<i>en route</i> to the village-green.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Moro-Moro, and the Fireworks.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Here has been hastily erected a large booth, around
which hundreds of natives are standing in an attitude of profound
interest. A moro-moro play is going on. This is a sort of Philippine
miracle-play, in which kings and queens and soldiers, and various
persons with Biblical names, contend together. There is rivalry, ruin,
and despair; there is death, murder, and awful retribution. It is a
tumultuous tragedy; in which, too, are some subtle and refined
elements, and a kind of gross humor, represented by the stage-fool and
by the lads that take the female parts. There is, however, no
coarseness; not a suggestion of it.</p>
<p>Love and religious persuasion and devotion mark the greatest number
of moro-moro performances, and while some of the plays are fairly
good,&mdash;not judging from too lofty a standpoint,&mdash;yet, on
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>the other hand, it is indeed amusing to note how
little in this line, how thin a texture, pleases the people, bombast
and fury, honeyed accents and unnecessary vicarious suffering, false
and flagrant violations of dramatic art&mdash;all alike are viewed with
breathless interest, and applauded, or stoically witnessed as the
occasion demands. The entire play is given in the Tagal language.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e3433width" id="p172"><img src="images/p172.jpg"
alt="A Scene from the Moro-Moro Play." width="697" height="524">
<p class="figureHead">A Scene from the Moro-Moro Play.</p>
</div>
<p>The native spectators, indeed, enter into the action of the play
with, as it were, a grim earnest; as if all their mental faculties were
judging complex emotions and nice situations.</p>
<p>Nothing, indeed, in the native character is more remarkable than its
unvarying decorum. Here the happy crowd has been standing for three
hours, agape with delight, drinking in the rude splendors of tinsel
potentates.</p>
<p>Here, too, they would be willing to stand for several hours more;
but it is nearly midnight, and a sudden illumination <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>on
the other side of the square announces that the time for departure is
almost at hand. It is seen that the villagers have constructed a
miniature castle, now ablaze with fire-works. Various designs are
traced by the spreading glow, and scores of rockets shoot into the sky,
dropping a shower of brilliant stars. Ever and anon, at some unusual
display, a murmur of applause rises from the admiring throng.
Entranced, they stay until the last rocket has been drowned in the vast
ocean of Night. Then all leave as silently as they came, and the
village square is soon deserted; while the lamps and lanterns are
allowed to burn till their glow is quenched in the brightness of the
morrow&rsquo;s sun.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Commerce has its two forms, the extensive and the
intensive; one that considers the world at large, and one that seeks to
confine itself to the interests of a nation. The latter, before the
nineteenth century, was everywhere the type of colonial commerce. The
nations held their colonies in leading strings; cramped and crowded
them in their natural growth, and so checked their development that
they lost the benefit that they might have gained from a more liberal
policy. Of all the nations, Spain pursued this short-sighted policy
most rigidly. Not only in commerce, but in everything else, she cramped
her colonies. Foreign trade was so sternly prohibited that, in her
period of supremacy, she put to death any alien merchant that ventured
into one of her ports. Her colonies were her cows; no one could milk
them but herself; but she milked them so dry as to starve them of their
natural yield.</p>
<p>Spain never learned the lesson that the other nations were taking to
heart. In the nineteenth century her policy with her colonies was as
illiberal as in the eighteenth. As a result, rebellions everywhere
broke out; one by one the colonies became free, and the country whose
possessions covered more than a continent at the beginning of the
century, held, at the end, but a shred of her once-splendid dominion.
Spain&rsquo;s treatment of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176"
href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span>Philippine Islands in their
commercial interests, forms a marked example of what I have previously
said, and an extended account of this remarkable method of trade cannot
fail to be of interest.</p>

<p>The Philippines, at first, in 1569, were too far away to be dealt
with directly, and were made an appanage of the intermediate colony of
Mexico, through which they were reached and controlled. The method was
curious. The natives were no sooner subdued and put under Spanish
governors than they were required to pay roundly in taxes and tribute
to the royal treasury. All this belonged to the crown, but some of it
had to be devoted to the government of the colony; and the Spanish
grandees that exiled themselves to that far land, took good care to pay
themselves well for the penance.</p>
<p>For many years the taxes were paid to the treasury wholly in
colonial produce, and for many more years, partly so. This material was
exchanged for Chinese wares, junks from the Celestial kingdom visiting
the islands each spring, and bartering silks and diverse goods of China
for the rice, hemp, and other produce of the islands, which had been
collecting during the year in the royal stores at Manila.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Treasure-galleons.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The method of dealing with the goods thus received
was, to say the least, peculiar. They were done up each year in bales,
always just fifteen hundred in number, and of exactly the same size and
shape, for shipment to Mexico. From the first year after the formation
of the colony until the year 1811, a fixed process was maintained.
Every year a State-galleon left Manila for Mexico, bearing the baled
Chinese goods, which represented the Philippine tribute. Every year the
ship returned with a portion of the proceeds to the starting-point,
this being known as the Mexican subsidy. One galleon and no more. For
two centuries, and longer, this rigid system was kept up, the commerce
of the islands being limited to this conveyance of tribute across the
seas. Navidad was at first the Mexican port of call. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span>Then
Acapulco was chosen, and for more than two hundred years the
State-galleon, Naos de Acapulco, yearly came and went across the
Pacific, carrying tribute for Spain. The ships employed were very
different from modern commercial craft. Short of length, wide of beam,
and light of draught, with high elevation in bow and stern, above water
they presented something of the outline of a crescent moon. They were
of about 1,500 tons burden, had four decks, and were provided with
guns; for, the waters they crossed were not secure from hostile craft,
and Spain not infrequently had the loss of one of her rich galleons to
mourn.</p>
<p>Thus it continued, until the rebellion in Mexico put an end to the
traffic, the last of the treasure-galleons leaving for Mexico in 1811.
The last for Manila set sail in 1815. There were other reasons than the
war to put an end to the old traffic. The expense had become too great
and the profit too small. Spain&rsquo;s finances had fallen into a
lamentable state, and the Naos de Acapulco was, perforce, withdrawn.
Needy politicians, who knew little about seamanship, but much about
perquisites, had forced themselves into the galleon, whose commander
received an annual salary of $40,000, the chief executive officer
$25,000, and the quartermaster nine per cent. of the cargo, the total
of which was no small sum.</p>
<p>It was an odd idea to restrict the commerce of a group of the
richest islands of the tropic seas, to a single vessel carrying the
annual tribute of the island. In fact, it was not quite so restricted.
The tribute-cargo did not fill the ship. There was some space left, and
the use of this was given to a few favored merchants, the Consulado, as
they were called, a trading ring, each member of which must have
resided a certain number of years in the Philippines, and have a
fortune of at least $8,000. This surplus freight was regulated by the
issue of boletas,&mdash;documents that long did duty as paper money,
passing from hand to hand. The demand for space much exceeded the
supply, and the right to ship on the annual galleon often went to
favored hands, merchants being set aside by churchmen, officials, and
others with grasping palms. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href=

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=

<p>It may be that the idea of adding to the island-trade by supplying
more ships, never penetrated the thick official cuticle of Spain. At
all events, the single galleon sailed back and forth year after year,
until the years lengthened into centuries, and while other nations were
sending their deeply-freighted craft to all the ports of the earth. It
was odd and lamentable to see this pitiful travesty of commercial
enterprise kept up until after the dawn of the busy nineteenth
century.</p>
<p>The yearly value of the official cargo sent from Manila was at first
limited to $250,000. But such was the demand for the goods in Mexico,
that one hundred per cent. was usually realized on the sales. The
return-trade was not permitted to exceed the value of the
proceeds,&mdash;$500,000, in coin or stores. In this way Mexican
dollars, the recognized coin of the colony, made their way thither in
large quantities. They were largely absorbed by China, where they were
highly welcome. A certain sum was necessary to maintain the colony.
This&mdash;the royal subsidy (Real Situado)&mdash;was fixed by decree
from time to time, coming out of the proceeds of the annual
tribute.</p>
<p>In saying that the annual galleon conveyed all the commerce of the
Philippines, I should have confined this statement to Western trade.
There was some commerce with the East. Indian and Persian goods reached
Manila in considerable quantities. The same was the case, as I have
stated, with Chinese wares. But the absurd restrictions of Spain
hampered this trade. No Spaniard was permitted to go to China to buy
his own goods. He must wait for the Chinese junks, and content himself
with what they chose to bring.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Tondo: the Ancient Quarter of Native
Fishermen.</p>
</div>
<p>The sailing of the annual galleon took place usually in July; and
the voyage occupied about five months. The route to be followed was
strictly laid down, and even the vagaries of the winds were scarcely an
excuse for deviating from it. As has been said, all was carefully
arranged as to size and number of bales and weight of cargo. For a
century and a half there was practically no competition in this trade,
and everything could be officially regulated, even to the selling-price
of the goods in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181"
name="pb181">181</a>]</span>Mexican market. The departure and arrival
of the galleon at Manila formed the great events of the year. At these
single dates the bars of exclusion were thrown down,&mdash;goods left,
and wealth returned to, the colony; new faces appeared, and rejoicing
was general. <i>Te Deums</i> were chanted in the churches, musicians
paraded the streets, filling the air with melody, and bunting by day
and illumination by night testified to the public joy.</p>
<p>Life was an easy affair with the merchants of Manila. Business was
never a distressing occupation. One or two days in each week were
Saint&rsquo;s days&mdash;to be strictly kept. While the galleon was
away, there was little to do except to await the Chinese junks and
prepare the bales for shipment. There was no rise or fall of
market-price, no need of smartness, tact, or enterprise, and only three
months in the year when active labor was needed. During the remaining
nine months the merchants were cut off from the world, and enjoyed life
in their quiet way, with little regard to the doings of mankind.</p>

<h3 class="main">Disasters to Spanish Commerce.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Now and then, however, a change came over the spirit
of their dreams. The seas are notoriously uncertain, and ship-captains
appointed by favor are not overmuch to be trusted. Disasters came.
Galleons went to sea and never came to port; shattered bones lay on
some inhospitable coast or found a grave on the bottom of the ocean.
And as time went on, hostile ships visited the Pacific and made prizes
of the rich galleons of Spain. Now the remittance from the Philippines
failed to reach Mexico. Now the scores of broad dollars sent back,
vanished on the seas.</p>

</div>
<p>The loss of the invincible Armada in 1588 put an end to
Spain&rsquo;s naval supremacy, and the richly-freighted American
galleons often became the prey of British buccaneers. The colony of the
Philippines had then just been formed, and was not disturbed until the
series of Anglo-Spanish wars before 1760, when its treasure-laden
galleons were frequently swept away. This was notably the case after
1743, when Admiral Anson&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182"
href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>fleet infested the coast and
became the terror of the Spanish islanders. His exploits filled Manila
with consternation, and councils were held to devise some method of
getting rid of him; but he set all their efforts at naught. The
captured galleon Pinar put a million and a half of dollars into his
treasure-chest: the Covadouga yielded him immense wealth. Spies upon
high promontories watched the seas for the dreaded British ships; the
people of Manila were held ready to defend the city from assault; every
one was on the alert. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href=
"#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span></p>
<p>For each lost galleon another was sent, and in some instances
several galleons had to be despatched in a single year. Yet there were
three or four occasions in which no galleon reached the Philippines for
two or three years; while, after the capture of the Covadouga six years
passed without a ship reaching the islands. The effect was disastrous:
coin grew scarce, misery prevailed, the Chinese traders broke into open
rebellion. There were other sources of revenue besides the Mexican
subsidy, but the officials felt their incomes seriously straitened in
these periods of want.</p>

<h3 class="main">Other Nations Enter Into Competition.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Spain lost not only through war, but through peace.
Her inelastic commerce invited competition, and British, Dutch, and
other merchants began to cut down the great profits of the Philippine
trade. These nations sent their ships to Canton, established factories,
and bought goods for themselves, cutting off the Spanish monopoly of
the traffic with the East. In 1731 foreign ships expended over
$3,000,000 of Mexican coin in China for goods. These were smuggled into
New Spain, not without help from Spaniards on shore. This proved a
serious competition. The old hundred-per-cent. profit was no longer to
be had. Acapulco was so beset with smugglers, whose merchandise found
its way clandestinely to the city of Mexico, that, at times, buyers
could not be found for the galleon-goods except at much reduced
rates.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Fraud now stepped in. Goods of inferior quality were
sent and offered at old prices. Government inspectors were appointed at
Manila to examine goods; but they filled their own pockets at the
expense of the public service, and the frauds went on. Contraband goods
were taken on the State-galleon itself, concealed in water-jars. The
misfortunes that came to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href=
"#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>Manila merchants in consequence,
were due largely to their own fault: they had &ldquo;sown the wind and
reaped the whirlwind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were certain public funds in Manila that offered themselves to
speculative uses. These&mdash;known as the Obras Pias&mdash;were
legacies left by pious persons whose interest was to be used to pay for
masses for their souls. Two-thirds were to be lent at interest to
traders, the remainder being held to cover losses. The Casa
Misericordia was another pious fund that was lent at 40 per cent.,
sinking to 20 per cent. as trade grew less profitable. In the end,
speculative ventures made way with much of this accumulated cash;
sorely, it may be, to the misery of the poor souls in Purgatory,
waiting to be prayed into Paradise.</p>

<p class="first">A new competition with Philippine commerce came into
play at the beginning of the eighteenth century,&mdash;that of the
merchants of C&aacute;diz, who had grown jealous of the shipments from
Manila to Mexico, which they claimed were injurious to the home-trade.
Petitions were therefore sent to the King, who, in response, put a new
curb on the scanty island-commerce, prohibiting trade with China in
woven goods, skins, silk, and clothing, except fine linen. The imports
from China were limited to fine linen, porcelain, wax, pepper,
cinnamon, and cloves. Six months&rsquo; grace was given, after which
all stocks of prohibited goods in Manila were to be burned, and all
sent to Mexico to be confiscated. There was nothing strange in this
decree. England was at that time practising the same restriction toward
her American colonies, though she did not order any goods to be
burned.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Decree followed decree during the ensuing years, all
pointing to the same end. In 1720 it was decreed that in future two
galleons might annually be sent to Mexico, but these were to be of only
500 tons, and their cargoes to be valued at $300,000, made <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>up
of non-prohibited goods. Ecclesiastics and foreigners were forbidden to
have anything to do with trade. In 1726 the prohibition on silks was
removed, but only one galleon was permitted to cross. A protest arose
from Spain against the Philippine trade in woven goods, which was
declared to be ruinous to the Spanish weaving industries, particularly
as the galleons took back Mexican coin instead of Spanish goods. As a
result, the 1720 decree was restored in 1731, to the dismay of the
Philippine merchants and the people of Mexico. For they had to pay
higher prices for Spanish goods, while their coffers were drained to
meet the Philippine deficit.</p>

<p>Other Royal decrees were issued from time to time, favoring or
injuring trade, and all with the general effect sure to arise from
interference with the natural course of commerce. Among these were
enactments intended to prevent Mexican capital from being invested in
the Philippines. All was done that could be to keep the islands in a
state of poverty and decadence.</p>
<p>To mention one further example of Spanish blindness&mdash;the
priests. Their meddling proved worse than that of the King. Through
their influence the non-Christian Chinese were expelled from the
islands in 1755, and with them went an industry that <span class="corr"
id="xd21e3567" title="Source: cause">caused</span> a deficit of $30,000
a year in the taxes. Trade grew stagnant in consequence of the loss of
these active shopkeepers, and the Philippines experienced what Spain
had experienced when Philip II. banished the Moorish agriculturists and
artisans. In both cases this concession to bigotry threw the country
into a deplorable state, and years passed before prosperity
returned.</p>

<p>The closing of the Chinese shops in Manila and the expulsion of the
Chinese merchants was the beginning of a new state of things in the
islands. A joint-stock company was formed to buy clothing and staple
goods for the Philippines, and sell at 30 per cent. advance. But the
Spaniards lacked the keenness at bargaining that their predecessors
possessed, and the company soon failed. Another company followed, under
the favor of the King of Spain, who took a large block of its shares
and gave it abundant privileges and monopolies. It&mdash;the Royal
Company of the Philippines, fully organized in 1785&mdash;was given
exclusive rights of trade, aside from the galleon trade with Acapulco.
Foreign ships were not allowed to bring goods from Europe to the
Philippines, though they could land Chinese and Indian goods.</p>
<p>There were old treaties that prohibited Spain from seeking the
Pacific by the eastern route, her trade being via Cape Horn and Mexico.
Charles III. quashed these treaties in favor of the Royal Company,
whose ships were allowed to sail by way of the Cape of Good Hope. No
one seriously objected&mdash;Spanish commerce was not worth an
objection. With its large capital and its privileges the Royal Company
should have flourished. But <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href=
"#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>it never did. Yet it benefited the
Philippines, and gave a great impulse to agriculture, on which large
sums of money were expended. The culture of sugar, tobacco, cotton,
indigo, and pepper was much developed, and these long remained the
staples of many provinces.</p>
<p>The company had splendid opportunities, but failed to make the most
of them. It broke down the vexatious prohibition to trade with the East
and with Spain, which had checked Philippine enterprise, but the dry
rot of Spanish incapacity caused its decay. Influence and intrigue
brought men into the company that lacked ability, but received large
salaries. As a result, it lost the power to compete with experts, while
the contraband trade ate into its profits, and the merchants of Manila
opposed its monopolies. Finally, in 1830, its privileges were taken
away, and the island-colony was opened to the trade of the world. Five
years afterward the Company ceased to exist. <span class=

<h3 class="main">The Restrictions Are Gradually Abolished.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Early in the nineteenth century foreigners made their
way past the bars of restriction. A Mr. Butler first asked the
privilege of residing in Manila, and opening up trade with Europe; but
his humble petition was rejected as something monstrous,&mdash;an
innovation that would put an end to the political security of the
colony. Yet the needs of commerce forced Spain out of this illiberal
attitude, and an American firm, Russell and Sturgis, was soon after
admitted by favor of the Governor-General. Then Mr. Butler came back.
Many others have since followed, and there are, to-day, about a dozen
British and as many German and Swiss firms in the ports of Manila,
Iloilo, and Ceb&uacute;, together with firms of other nations.</p>
<p>The house of Russell &amp; Sturgis was long prominent in Philippine
trade. It opened up the sugar culture in the isle of Negros, invested a
large amount of money in agriculture, and was long the mainspring of
Philippine enterprise. But it was, in the end, victimized by the
natives, to whom its capital had been largely advanced, and in 1875, to
the amazement and consternation of the people, the great firm failed.
For a time its failure paralyzed trade, but the minor firms it had
overshadowed soon expanded, and business grew brisker than before.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But while foreign merchants were thus forcing their
way into the Philippines, they had to contend against the peculiar
Spanish ideas of commercial enterprise. The customs duties&mdash;at
that time seven per cent. on goods in Spanish ships&mdash;were double
that in foreign vessels. And the most vexatious regulations prevailed.
Thus there was a system of levying tonnage-dues on foreign vessels in
addition to duties, a cargo-ship being charged double the dues of one
in ballast. If a ship in ballast should land the smallest parcel, it
was at once charged the higher rate. And it is said that the officials
sometimes bribed a sailor to carry <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192"
href="#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span>a small bundle on shore, to
give them a pretext to make the higher charge. The story is told, that,
one shipmaster, who had brought a cargo of cobble-stones to Manila, was
severely fined because his cargo proved to be one stone short of the
number on his manifest.</p>

<p>In 1896 the collector of customs at Manila made $82,000 in this way,

Spanish officials managed to make their positions profitable, but they
drove away trade, foreign shippers avoiding Manila.</p>

Spanish privilege.</p>
<p>To-day subsidized Spanish steamers have most of the import trade,
though the export trade is done mainly by foreign vessels. These carry
cargoes to Asiatic ports, discharge them, and proceed in ballast to the
islands. No foreigner is permitted to own a vessel trading between
Spain and any of her colonies, or between one colony and another, or
doing a coast-trade from island to island. But this law is readily
evaded, by foreigners giving to Spaniards the nominal ownership of
their vessels. In this way a large part of the internal trade of the
Philippines has fallen into foreign hands.</p>

opposition. Spain is not a mercantile nation, and its commercial ideas
are centuries behind the age. Only constant pressure forced the
Philippine authorities into more liberal measures, yet the island-trade
remained deplorably fettered, as compared <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb193" href="#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>with general
commerce. Proposed reforms, demands to introduce modern improvements,
were alike unwelcome, the Church especially resisting innovation.
Useless and obstructive formalities stood in the way of trade;
vexatious delays were made; and the development of the colony seems to
have been the last thought in the Governor-General&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>By a Royal decree, in 1844, strangers were excluded from the
interior of the islands. In 1857 old decrees were used to prevent
foreign establishments in the colony. In 1886 foreign trade was
declared prejudicial to the &ldquo;material interests of the
country.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Trade with the Natives.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The conservatism and ignorance of the natives have
similarly stood in the way of commercial progress. They could not be
made to understand that the change in quotations was not due to the
caprice of buyers. Many of them lost by withholding goods when the
quotations did not please them. Only in 1884, when the whole world was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>affected by the crisis in the sugar trade, could
they be made to perceive that quotations were quite beyond the control
of the merchants.</p>
<p>Accustomed to deal with the Chinese, the natives have no fixed
prices for their products. The Chinese understand them, and put prices
on their goods that will allow for a large reduction. In the end, the
native goes away contented, though the shrewd Chinaman has usually the
best of the bargain. Even important mercantile houses seldom state
prices, business being conducted on the shifting Asiatic scale. Foreign
capitalists distrust trade with the natives, whose word usually cannot
be depended upon, and employ middlemen to collect produce. These are
persons born in the colony, who understand at once the business methods
of the foreigner and the shifty customs of the natives. And they
generally bring the opposite parties to terms.</p>
<p>The only real basis of wealth in the Philippines is the raw material
of agriculture and the forest. Nothing has been done to foster the
industrial arts, and the manufactures are insignificant, the cigar
product being the principal one.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">From the opening of the large export trade until
recently, Americans were supreme. But the failure of the great house of
Russell &amp; Sturgis made a change. Other traders rose upon their
ruins, and of late years England has gained the bulk of the trade. The
downfall of the Americans was completed after the outbreak of the Cuban
troubles in 1895. The Spanish hatred of the Yankee was reflected in
these far-off islands, and, by petty annoyances that soon became
intolerable, the last American firms were crowded out.</p>

<h3 class="main">Recent Measures and Statistics.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In 1891 a protective tariff was laid by Spain on the
trade of the Philippines. This diverted to the home-country most of the
traffic formerly enjoyed by England and other countries. Iron
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>goods and hardware are now furnished principally
by Germany and Switzerland, but the Manchester cotton goods are
supplemented by similar fabrics made in Barcelona. The imports from the
United States are chiefly kerosene oil and flour.</p>
<p>As an indication of the growth of Philippine trade since the
intrusion of foreign shippers put an end to the medi&aelig;val
obstructions of Spain, some figures may be quoted:</p>
<div class="figure xd21e3665width" id="p195"><img src="images/p195.jpg"

<p class="figureHead">A Village of Santa Ana</p>
</div>
<p>In 1841 the imports of the islands aggregated in value $3,230,000,
the exports, $4,370,000. In 1885 the imports had increased to
$19,171,468; the exports to $24,553,686. In 1893 the imports aggregated
$25,500,000; the exports $30,000,000. These figures are estimated,
however, in Mexican dollars, the currency of the islands, which is at a
large discount elsewhere.</p>
<p>In 1895 the principal exports of the Philippines were: Hemp,
$14,517,000; sugar, $10,975,000; tobacco, $3,159,000; cocoanuts,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>$356,000. This fell off greatly in 1896, on
account of the increased scale of export duties, hemp declining to
$7,500,000, and sugar to $10,975,000.</p>
<p>On August 21, 1897, a decree went into effect that imposed an
extraordinary customs duty of 6 per cent. <i lang="la">ad valorem</i>
on all merchandise imports, without regard to the country whence they
came.</p>

</div>
<p>The trade of the United States with the Philippines has been
steadily on the decline within recent years. In 1888 their imports from
the islands were valued at $10,268,278; in 1897, at $4,383,760. The
export trade has always been insignificant, as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span>compared with European countries. In 1889 it
aggregated $165,903; in 1897 it was only $94,567. During the same
period the exports of Spain to the islands increased from $890,000 to
$7,972,583. These were principally cotton fabrics. The exports from the
United States embraced mineral oil, bread stuffs, cotton goods,
chemicals, iron and steel goods. Of the imports, the most important
were Manila hemp and sugar; other imports include cigars, tobacco,
woods, hides, shells, indigo, and coffee.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Bad Result of Spanish Rule.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The foreign trade of the Philippines has always been
subject to great fluctuations, owing to insecurity under the Spanish
administration, the dissatisfaction of the native population, and to
the frequent insurrections. These influences have stood seriously in
the way of developing the wealth of the islands. Under a new and
progressive administration, there seems nothing to hinder this fertile
region from becoming one of the garden spots of the earth.</p>
<p>The possession of the Philippines, on the other hand, has not been a
bonanza for Spain. The expenses cut so deeply into the revenues that
only a few hundred thousand dollars were left yearly for the Crown. The
bulk of the proceeds fell into the hands of the clergy and the hidalgos
sent out to rob and misgovern the islands. In addition to the revenue
to the King, a few Spanish noblemen receive pensions from the islands.
Among them are the Duke of Veragua and the Marquis of Barboles, both
descendants of Columbus, and, as such, entitled to the consideration of
the United States.</p>
<p>The Spanish receipts were obtained from everything that could be
taxed. In truth, the people were crowded wherever possible, and kept in
a state of chronic irritation. This made them ready at any time to
break into rebellion.</p>
<p>As regards the expenditure of money raised by taxes and duties,
while little came to the King, little also was spent on the islands. It
was estimated that in 1897 $611,145 were expended <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>on
public works. If so, the result was not visible in the Philippines. If
a bridge was needed, the neighboring nations had to raise the money to
build it. More money was set aside for the transportation of priests
than for the building of railroads, while ten times the sum was donated
to the support of the Manila Cathedral than was spent for new
improvements and for public instruction. Regarding the officials, from
the Governor-General down to the lowest underling, they seem to have
devoted themselves industriously to robbing the people with one hand
and the Government with the other, sowing a crop of hatred of the
Spaniard and of Spanish rule, which had its harvest in the fierce
insurrection of 1896&ndash;98.</p>

<h3 class="main">Agriculture&mdash;The Chief Industry.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The land is the mainstay of the Philippines, and
farming is the native occupation. Manufacture is a diversion to which
the natives do not take kindly. The only industrial art that has made
any progress is the rolling of tobacco into cigars and cigarettes. Many
thousands of people are engaged in this occupation at Manila, but,
otherwise, manufacture is almost at a standstill. A little cordage is
made; some straw or split-bamboo hats are fashioned and shipped; in
some provinces split-cane and Neto hats and straw mats are made. Iloilo
yields a rough cloth,&mdash;sinamay, made from selected hemp fibre.
Pi&ntilde;a muslin, made of pure pine-leaf fibre, and husi, of mixed
pine-leaf and hemp, are fabricated. Those, with a few other articles,
make up the native manufactured products. They do not occupy the
attention of the people, the greater part of the population getting
their livelihood from the fields.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Weaving the Beautiful Pi&ntilde;a Cloth.</p>
</div>
<p>Plantation life is the industrial unit of the islands. The soil is
divided up into plantations, large and small, according to the capital
and enterprise of the planter. As a rule, the planters are of the Malay
race, and the work of the fields is done by other Malays, as many as
five or six hundred being employed on large plantations. The laborers
live in little bamboo houses, the planters <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>furnishing them both food and clothing. The food
consists of rice and fish,&mdash;very cheap provender in the
Philippines,&mdash;and the clothing is of a primitive character, that
costs little. Yet, at the end of the season, the laborer has usually
exhausted his wages and may be in debt to the planter.</p>
<p>On the other hand, though the planter holds the land, he is
generally obliged to borrow the capital to work it. This he obtains
from a middleman, who stands between him and the great merchants, the
exporters of the island-produce. The middlemen are generally mestizos.
They contract for the crop in advance, on behalf of the rich exporters,
from whom they obtain the money lent to the planters. This capital is
lent at an interest-rate of from ten to twelve per cent. They, in turn,
lend it to the planters at a considerable advance,&mdash;say, twenty to
thirty, and often as much as fifty, per cent. I have heard of even one
hundred per cent. being demanded. Thus the planter is ground between
the upper and nether millstone,&mdash;the exporter and the middlemen.
They alone make any money, the producer being normally in debt, as his
laborers are likewise to him.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Principal Products of the Colony.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The products of the islands are various, including
maize, rice, cotton, coffee, tobacco, sugar-cane, the cocoanut, the
abac&aacute;, or manila hemp plant, and a large number of dye-woods,
medicinal, and other useful plants, such as ebony, sapan-wood,
tamarind, bamboo, numerous palms, fibrous plants, etc. But I am now
concerned only with the agricultural products, and shall therefore
confine this chapter to a consideration of two of the more
important&mdash;rice and sugar.</p>
<p>In former years, the few that faced the obstacles to agriculture in
an unworked country succeeded in obtaining fair returns in wealth from
the cultivation of the main staples. But those palmy days exist no
longer: prices have declined to one-third their former level, while the
wages of the laborers have risen. The buffalo, the indispensable aid of
the farmer, could then be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href=
"#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span>obtained for one-fifth its present
cost, on account of the limited demand. Trade in those days was much
less than at present, but the native producers and traders occupied a
sounder position, and comfort existed, where penury now prevails.</p>

<p>Of late years, hundreds have gone into agriculture with much too
little capital. They hold the land, but frequently without the deeds to
show for it. Hence, their property is not negotiable, and they are
thrown into the hands of the money-lender, who squeezes the life-blood
from the unlucky planter. As agriculture <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb203" href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>yields less than
thirty per cent., and this or more has to be paid in interest on
capital, the contract is likely to end in the money-lender getting the
land. Few of the planters succeed in saving their estate and throwing
off their load of debt.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Cultivation of Sugar-cane.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The species of sugar-cane cultivated in the
Philippines (saccharum violaceum) differs from that grown in the west,
but it is the same as that found throughout Malaysia and Polynesia
generally. The culture and manufacture are conducted in a very slovenly
fashion, consequently the sugar produced is coarse of grain and poor in
quality. The yield, however, is large, and leaves, after the demands of
the islands are supplied, some 250,000 tons annually for export. With
proper cultivation this could be very much increased and its quality
greatly improved.</p>
<p>The culture of the cane extends through the islands of Negros,
Panay, Ceb&uacute;, Luzon, and, in some measure, throughout the entire
Archipelago. The yellow variety is grown in Pampanga (Luzon), the
purple in Panay and Negros. The price of cane-land varies considerably,
according to its facilities for drainage, transportation, and the like.
Thus, in the province of Bulacan, adjoining Manila, whose soil has been
exhausted by long cultivation,&mdash;the yield being but 20 tons per
acre,&mdash;land is held at the high figure of $115 per acre. In the
more distant province of Pampanga, land can be had for $75, though the
yield per acre is 30 tons. Nueva Eciji, still farther away, and
presenting difficulties of transportation, yields 35 tons to the acre,
yet the land-price is little over $30. The development of an extensive
railroad-system would change all this.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e3753width" id="p204"><img src="images/p204.jpg"
alt="Natives Preparing the Ground for Sugar-cane Planting." width="720"
height="458">
<p class="figureHead">Natives Preparing the Ground for Sugar-cane
Planting.</p>
</div>
<p>The high price of land in Bulacan is due mainly to sentimental
considerations. The cane plantations there were laid out centuries ago,
and have been held in the same families for many generations. In
consequence, the natives cling to them with the strength of hereditary
affection, and will part with the family estates only for fancy prices.
Nature has made the soil of the Philippines so wonderfully <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>rich
and fertile, that artificial fertilizers are never employed, the land
being expected, year after year, and century after century, to do its
duty and yield its full return. In view of these considerations, it
need hardly be said that American capital and enterprise would make a
remarkable change in the land.</p>
<p>The finest sugar-cane region is the island of Negros, in the Visaya
district. This island is about equal to Porto Rico in size. The culture
of the cane began there about 1850, in which year the crop was 625
tons. Not more than half its area is cultivated, from lack of capital,
but it now sends to the port of Iloilo over 80,000 tons of sugar for
exportation. Uncleared sugar-land there is held at $35 per acre,
cleared land at $70, the average yield being estimated at 40 tons per
acre on new, and 30 tons on old, estates. But the latter give sugar of
much higher grade, and need less labor in handling, so that there is no
loss in the value of the crop.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Methods of Manufacturing Sugar.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The process of manufacture differs in the north and
the south. In Negros the cane-juice is evaporated to that point of
concentration in which the molasses is incorporated with the grain.
Then the liquid is placed in wooden troughs of about eight by four feet
in size, and stirred with shovels until cooled sufficiently not to form
a solid mass. When cold, the lumps are pounded and broken up, and the
whole is packed in grass-bags for shipment. In the north the process is
carried further, efforts being made to get rid of the molasses. When
the boiled mass has set, the pots containing it are put over pots into
which the molasses drains. If left thus for six months, twenty per
cent. of the original weight will drain off. The molasses is sold to
distillers to make alcohol, and there is some demand for it to mix with
water for horses.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e3769width" id="p206"><img src="images/p206.jpg"
alt="Old Fashioned Process of Drying Black Sugar." width="720" height=
"462">
<p class="figureHead">Old Fashioned Process of Drying Black Sugar.</p>
</div>
<p>The Iloilo sugar generally comes to the United States, being shipped
in the raw state, to be refined there. In Manila the manufacture of
sugar has been more developed, and a quantity of crystal grain is
produced there for export to Spain. The old method of grinding the
cane, introduced by the Chinese, consists in the use <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>of
two rough vertical cutting mills,&mdash;cylinders of wood being used in
the south; of stone in the north. These are fitted with wooden teeth,
between which the grain is crushed. Mills of this primitive kind are
still in use in parts of the country, but are being superseded by iron
rollers sent from England, and, like the former, revolved by buffaloes.
Steam mills are also being introduced. In Negros, where foreign
influence is predominant, nearly all the mills are of European
make.</p>
<p>It may be said, further, in this connection, that the sugar-estates
are generally small, not a dozen in the country yielding more than
1,000 tons of raw sugar a year. One that yields 500 tons is declared
large. And the lack of transportation, too, greatly checks enterprise.
In Negros there are no canals or railroads to the coast, and the annual
crop needs to be painfully hauled in buffalo carts, to be loaded on
schooners, for carriage to the port of Iloilo. Buffaloes on this
island, five years old, bring $30. In Luzon they can be bought for half
that price. The wages paid to laborers average about one and a half
dollars weekly. But, in estimating the comparative comfort to be
derived from this, we must consider the low price of food and clothing,
and the primitive habits of the islanders.</p>
<p>The highest table-lands are most suitable for cane-planting, good
drainage being a necessity of the situation. The shoots are planted in
February, and the cane is cut in the following December or January. In
the West Indies the canes are planted widely, and the ratoons, or
root-stocks, last from five to twenty years, sending up new shoots
annually. In the Philippines, however, the planting is renewed
annually, the canes being set much closer. After cutting, the milling
should be done in ten weeks, delay causing much loss in sugar. The
whole process of milling and planting should be completed by the middle
of March, the remainder of the year being left to the growth and
culture of the crop.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Several Systems of Labor.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the north the co-operative principle of labor is
largely employed, each tenant being provided with the necessary
buffaloes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>and implements, and attending to the cane as if
it were his own. He provides the hands for cane-crushing and
sugar-making, while the land-owner supplies other necessaries, and has
to take the risk of typhoons, droughts, locusts, and the like. The
tenants receive, as their share, from a third to a half of the crop,
according to the bargain made. Nevertheless, they are generally in debt
to the owner and are looked upon as his servants.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Cane-stalk Yard, Tanduay; Drying Crushed Cane for

</div>
<p>In the south the plantations are worked on the wage system. Here
great vigilance is needed to keep the men properly to their tasks,
overseers being employed, who have an interest in the crop. The
overseer in some instances provides his own capital, and receives
two-thirds of the yield as his share. In 1877 a British company, with
large capital, organized, to buy the cane-juice and to extract from it
highly-refined sugar. Every preparation was made, but from the first
the enterprise was a failure, and the concern wound up in 1880, the
stockholders suffering severely for their faith. Yet fortunes have been
made in Philippine sugar, and until 1883 the crop could usually be
depended on to pay a good profit to the capitalist and leave something
for the borrower. The custom introduced in Europe, in 1884, of paying
subsidies to the beet-root cultivator, proved ruinous to the islanders,
and interest on capital is now the only return to be looked for.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Rice Crop.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Turning now from the sugar to the rice crop, I may say
that it is the staple food of the people, the crop upon which the very
existence of the people depends. It is grown in every province,
rice-cultivation being the only branch of agriculture that the people
thoroughly understand, and into which they enter with the zest of
evident enjoyment. Rice, a native plant of the East, has from time
immemorial been the leading food-product of all the nations of Eastern
Asia. The wild plant, from which all the cultivated varieties have been
derived, is still plentiful in the marshy, tropical countries of
southern Asia and northern Australia; while the people of India, China,
and the islands of the ocean live very largely on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>this
nutritive grain. It is known by as many as 1,300 different local names,
and it is said that Bengal alone has displayed 4,000 distinct forms of
rice. These differences are in color, shape, and size, and may be all
referred to a few well-marked varieties of Oryza sativa, the rice
plant. In India and the Philippines rice in the husk is called paddy,
and this word comes constantly into play in speaking of the cultivation
of the plant.</p>
<p>Formerly, rice was the main crop of the Philippines; a considerable
quantity being exported. Twenty years ago Sual was an important port
for the shipment of rice to China. It has now declined to an
insignificant village. In fact, the extension of sugar culture has so
reduced that of rice, that not enough is now produced for use, and
large quantities are imported from Siam, Burmah, and China. Pangasinan
is still a large rice-growing province, but all its product is consumed
within the country. Sugar is a much better-paying crop, its minimum
profit being equal to the maximum profit on rice. Rice-planting, in
fact, is not profitable, and few carry it on largely; yet, inasmuch as
it is necessary for the subsistence of the populace, some degree of
attention compels its culture.</p>

<p class="first">There are over twenty different kinds of rice-paddy
grown in the Philippines. These constitute two groups,&mdash;the
highland rice, grown in localities where inundation cannot be used, and
the lowland, with which inundation is easy. The latter, known as Macan,
is of much the finer quality, the most esteemed variety being that of
white grain. Paga, or highland rice, is in large proportion of red
grain. Its return is but half that of the Macan rice, but only one crop
of the latter can be grown annually, while usually three crops of Paga
rice are raised. One difficulty in Paga rice-cultivation is the
presence of a fly that sucks the flower and prevents seeding. These the
planters whisk off morning and evening with a bunch of straw, tied to
the end of a stick.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Native Women Hulling Rice.</p>
</div>
<p>The Macan grain is sown in June, in a plot set aside for seeding,
and saturated with water until it is a mass of mud. Here in six
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>weeks the plants grow to the height of a foot.
They are then pulled up by the roots and transplanted in the flooded
fields, in which the final growth is to be attained. Around these
fields banks of earth are raised to prevent the water from flowing off.
The men raise and separate the plants, and the women set them out
again, one plant at a time, wading through the soft mud, in which they
often sink to the knees. The process seems a tedious one, but I have
often been surprised to see the rapidity with which the natives perform
it. It is a process in which they are thoroughly trained, and at which
they are remarkably quick. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href=
"#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span></p>
<p>Four months more are needed for the ripening of the grain, during
which the fields are kept clear of weeds, the natives wading back and
forth through the mud in their task. After cutting and heaping, the
paddy is made into stacks. In six weeks more the grain is separated
from the straw by treading or by the use of the flail, or by causing
ponies to trot over it. It may be said that there is nothing in nature
more beautiful than a valley of green ripening rice in the midst of
verdant hills. In the flood of rich color beneath my eyes, I have gazed
upon such a scene with inexpressible delight.</p>

<h3 class="main">Primitive Machines, and Importance of the Rice
Crop.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">No rice-husking, winnowing or pearling-machines are in
use in the Philippines other than some small ones for domestic use. The
great number of kinds of rice-paddy hinders their use on a large scale,
since the mill adapted to one field would not clean the crop of
another. The grain is generally husked in a large hard-wood mortar,
where it is beaten with a pestle, several men and women at times
working over one mortar. There is also in use a primitive wooden mill
worked by buffaloes. In this a series of pins engage with each other,
causing a column to lift and fall, thereby serving as a pestle as it
falls. Steam and water-power have recently been brought into use in
some localities.</p>
<p>It is said that one quinon (about seven acres) of land will yield
from 250 to 300 cavans (about 96 pounds each) of rice, but the yield
could be greatly increased if a system of irrigation were generally in
use. At present, the dependence is largely on the rains. The yield from
seed varies from 40 to 100 grains of crop to one seed, 50 grains being
a good average. A family of five persons will consume about 250 pounds
of rice per month. It is used in almost every native dish, and takes
the place of bread. The paddy, or unhulled rice, is to feed horses,
cattle, and fowls.</p>
<p>It may be said in conclusion, that the rice and sugar planters have
many insect enemies to contend against. One of the worst is the locust,
which makes its appearance at times in overwhelming <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span>multitudes, and whose ravages I have elsewhere
described. In some degree it replaces the food it destroys, the natives
cooking and eating their foes, and in some districts, looking upon them
as a luxury whose coming is worth praying for.</p>
<p>The average annual production of rice is a million and a half
piculs, and almost a million piculs are imported.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Description of the Abac&aacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">First and foremost among the useful plants of the
Philippines stands musa textilis, a species of plantain that grows wild
in many of the islands and is the source of the well-known Manila hemp,
the most valuable of all fibres for cordage. The native name for the
plant is abac&aacute;. In appearance it is not easy to distinguish it
from the plant of the same genus that yields us that useful and
agreeable fruit, the banana. The only visible difference really is that
the banana tree is taller and its leaves are of a lighter green. The
most marked distinction is in the fruit, that of the abac&aacute; being
small and unfit for eating.</p>
<p>Properly considered, the abac&aacute;, like all the plantains, is an
herb, not a tree; that is, it bears flowers and fruit once only, then
perishes. The root survives, however, and a new plant springs up. The
abac&aacute; attains an average height of ten feet, though it sometimes
grows much higher. Its favorite location is on hilly land, and it
refuses to grow in swampy situations. I have often found it growing
wild on mountain slopes of volcanic formation, where the little depth
of soil scarcely gave it room to root.</p>
<p>The value of this plant lies in its leaves, the petioles, or
leaf-stalks, containing a long and strong fibre, for which it is widely
cultivated. Little attention is given to the plant during its three
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>years of growth. At the end of that time it
sends up a central stem, upon which flowers appear. Now comes the work
of the cultivator. Fruit is not permitted to appear, the flower-stem
being cut away and the leaf-stalks that surround it torn into strips
five or six inches wide, their length being over six feet.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Process of Manufacture.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Bast, the name by which these strips are known, is
made up of hemp-fibre and a soft pulpy substance enclosing it. The
process of manufacture is a very simple one,&mdash;consisting in
scraping this soft substance from the fibre. This work is done by the
natives in a primitive fashion. Nevertheless, no one, so far, has been
able to improve upon it.</p>
<p>The scraping instrument consists of a dull knife, which is attached
by a hinge to a block of wood. To this is connected a treadle worked by
the foot, by whose aid the operator scrapes the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>fresh leaf-strips under the knife, with the
degree of force that may be thought necessary. The bast is drawn along
between the knife and the block, forcing out the pulp, which remains on
the side of the knife, while the fibre, as it is set free, is wound by
the operator round a stick of wood.</p>
<p>Only one further process is necessary. The fibre in its fresh state
is very moist, containing about fifty-six per cent. of water. To
dispose of this, it is laid in the sun to dry and left for about five
hours, when it is considered ready for use. All that remains to be
done, then, is to prepare it for shipment, which is done by packing
tightly in bales and binding with hoops of iron or rattan.</p>
<p>The method of cleaning the bast, as described, has long been
practised by the islanders. Many attempts have been made to improve
upon it, but with no shining success. In fact, the various machines
that have been devised for the removal of the pulp usually have done
more harm than good. A machine that seeks to clean the whole length of
a strip of bast at once, is sure to break the fibre, which is not
strong enough to bear the strain. In the machines a cylinder takes the
place of the hand and the stick of the operator, and those cylinders,
whether of steel or of glass, are always found to discolor the fibre,
and thus reduce its marketable value. The only machine I know of that
avoids this defect is the invention of Don Abelardo Cuesta, a Spaniard,
brought out in 1886. This yielded excellent results, but required so
many hands to run it that it did not pay. The result is, nearly all the
fibre that is shipped is cleaned by the old native hand-process.</p>

<h3 class="main">Some Facts about Hemp-growing.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hemp-growing is the least troublesome of the
agricultural operations in the Philippines, and gives the best returns
for the expense involved. In starting a plantation the colonist chooses
forest land, clearing away the smaller growth, but leaving the large
trees to shade the plants and the young shoots. Where the soil is
virgin, each shoot occupies, at first, a space of ground thirty-six
Spanish square feet in extent. When the original plant is felled, the
suckers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>come up anywhere, growing spontaneously from the
parent root, and yielding a much denser plantation.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e3880width" id="p217"><img src="images/p217.jpg"
alt="A Hemp Warehouse, Manila." width="553" height="446">
<p class="figureHead">A Hemp Warehouse, Manila.</p>
</div>
<p>The abac&aacute; can be raised from seed; in which case it requires
four years to flower. Planters, however, generally transplant the
six-months-suckers, which, as I have said, reach maturity in three
years. Maturity, for commercial purposes, signifies the flowering
stage. In no case is the plant allowed to bear fruit, because
fruit-bearing weakens the outer fibre.</p>
<p>Ample capital is necessary for success in hemp-growing, inasmuch as
three years or more must pass before any profit can be had. After that,
the grower can depend upon an annual yield. But even then, when he is
the owner of a flourishing plantation, he has serious difficulties to
contend with. The amount of waste is enormous, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>some
thirty per cent. of the fibre being lost through carelessness and
negligence. The natives often cut the leaf-stalks before they reach
maturity. In other cases, they fail to do so till they have rotted on
the plant.</p>
<p>Inefficiency takes still other forms, but, despite this, there is
abundant margin for gain, since no agricultural operation is conducted
with less risk. The dense protecting forest-growth shields the plants
from hurricanes, while the high land on which they grow is safe from
inundation. Fire can make no headway among their green leaves and moist
stems. Locusts will not touch the hemp plant, and beetles and other
insects harm it but little. As the crop comes to maturity at successive
periods, it can be leisurely gathered, from time to time, the year
round. No ploughing is needed, and therefore there is no live-stock to
be purchased, fed, and cared for. There is no expensive machinery, and
no highly-priced machinists needed to run it. Weeding must be carefully
attended to, but this is the work of the natives, and is done very
cheaply. The enemies of the hemp planter are an occasional drought when
his plants are in the ground, and the danger of fire to his dried bales
before they reach their destination. His greatest annoyance must come
from the steady thirty per cent. of what seems like unnecessary waste,
due to the causes stated.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Difficulties with Native Labor.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Work on an abac&aacute; estate is performed on the
co-operative plan. The laborers are paid not in money but in kind, they
receiving half the fibre they clean, while the other half goes to the
owner of the estate. The workman, however, is not required to take the
fibre for his pay, but receives, instead, its current cash
value&mdash;if not cheated, which he frequently is. The law of the
Philippines, however, is cheat for cheat, the native having become
quite as tricky as his master. The value of the fibre depends upon its
whiteness and its strength, and both are reduced by the indolence and
dishonesty of the hands. My experience with the islanders is, I admit,
that they are none too fond of work. A laborer on a hemp <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>plantation, who finds himself pressed for money,
is likely to take some method like the following to obtain it: he will
seek an abac&aacute; plant, strip a few of its leaf-stalks, and leave
them exposed to the rain and the air. As a result, the bast grows soft
and rotten, and is more easily cleaned, but the fibre is weakened and
discolored. In cleaning it, he uses a <i>toothed</i> knife,&mdash;a
form forbidden by the trade, since it adds to the discoloration. As the
fibre is sold by weight, the dishonest manipulator is careful to leave
some of the pulp to dry upon it and so increase the number of pounds.
Carrying his bundle of coarse, partly-cleaned, discolored, and weak
fibre, he seeks the dealer at night, that he may be deceived as to the
color of the fibre. These tricks are well known to the planter, his
manager, and to the acopiadores, or dealers at large, and do not often
succeed.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e3903width" id="p219"><img src="images/p219.jpg"

<p class="figureHead">A Hemp Press at a Busy Hour.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span></p>
<p>The plantation-owners make every effort to force the natives to use
knives without teeth, in order that the fibre may be fine, perfectly
clean, and white. The Filipino, though, if not closely watched,
persists in using his serrated knife, because if he uses one with a
smooth edge he loses in weight. He is too ignorant to perceive that the
fibre properly treated is of higher value. It is quite possible, as is
often claimed, that there is a difference in plants, some giving a
whiter fibre than others. But it is generally conceded that if the
natives would cut the plant only at maturity, cleanse the fibre under a
toothless knife the same day, place the strips in a clean place, and
sun-dry at once, the waste would be materially lessened, and there
would be little third-class matter.</p>
<p>In other words, what the hemp-planter needs are honest, reliable
hands and an efficient manager.</p>
<p>On some of the islands inspectors are appointed by the Governor,
whose duty it is to travel about from place to place, intimidating
hemp-laborers in the name of the law. But so far their efforts seem to
have met with but little success, the plantations owned by foreigners
being large, remote, and difficult to reach; they are, indeed, nearly
always on the sides of mountains. In the extraction of the fibre the
natives work in couples: one man strips the bast, another draws it
under the knife. A fair week&rsquo;s work for the two, including
selection and felling of plants, and cleansing and drying of bast, is 2
&#8203;1&frasl;7&#8203; piculs&mdash;about 300 pounds. First-quality
fibre brings in Manila $8.50 a picul, and third-quality $7.25; but
while the former price remains firm, the latter falls as the poor
quality increases. Nevertheless, as may be seen, the native gets good
wages even for a poor quality of hemp.</p>
<p>The work of the laborers is by no means confined to treating the
fibre, they being expected to devote some time every day to weeding the
plants, and clearing out brushwood. This is part of their regular work
and is not paid for extra. The baling of the fibre is done by means of
a press, at which men and boys work, their rate of payment varying from
12&frac12; to 50 cents a day. Transportation from the plantations to
the shipping points, such as Manila and Ceb&uacute;, is also to be
considered in estimating the outlay of the planter. <span class=

</div>
<p>I have not yet told all the tricks of the natives. They cheat also
in the planting, by not making deep enough holes for setting out the
shoots. In consequence, planters no longer pay at once for shoots and
labor, as formerly, but reserve payment for three years, or until full
growth is attained. Then $10 are paid for each hundred of live
plants.</p>
<p>In addition to the large planters, many of the Filipinos produce
bast in a small way, selling it to Chinese dealers. Or a Chinaman may,
for a petty sum, gain the right to work a native plantation for a fixed
term of years. With but one thought in mind&mdash;that of immediate
gain&mdash;he strips the plants in their immature stage, producing a
white but weak fibre, and returns the plantation to its owner ruined
for the time being. The Chinese are, in consequence, held under
suspicion, and their bast is severely inspected before purchase.</p>
<p>In fact, the whole process of hemp-production, from the proprietor
down to the lowest laborer, seems permeated with fraud; and between
efforts to cheat on the one hand, and efforts to escape being cheated
on the other, life on a hemp plantation is not a state of beatitude.

<h3 class="main">Competition with Other Lands.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Manila hemp never fails of a market, particularly in
the United States, where it is most largely used. No other fibre known
is so valuable for cordage, and the production might be greatly
increased without overstocking the market. To the various frauds
practised in its production may be added another employed by the
manufacturers of cordage: the free adulteration of the pure Philippine
fibre by the admixture of New Zealand flax and Russian hemp.</p>
<p>The cultivation of the plant has been attempted outside the
Philippines, but with no satisfactory result. Abac&aacute; planting, it
is true, was tried successfully in the botanical gardens at Saigon,
Cochin China, but the experiment was abandoned, for some reason
unexplained. Abac&aacute; has also been planted in British India, and
flourished as well there as at Saigon, but the effort to produce hemp
from it failed through ignorance of the proper method of the drawing of
the fibre.</p>
<p>The mode of extraction tried was that practised with the ordinary
hemp of India, excepting that the stems were first passed through a
sugar-cane mill, to get rid of the sap. By this means fifty
<span class="corr" id="xd21e3941" title="Source: percent.">per
cent.</span> of the whole weight was squeezed out; the stems were then
immersed in water and left to rot for ten or more days; afterward they
were washed by hand and dried in the sun. Less than two pounds of fibre
were thus gained from one hundred pounds of stems, and this bad in
color and lacking in strength.</p>
<p>This method is very unlike that employed in the Philippines, and the
natives of the islands need have no fear of Indian competition under
such conditions. The fibre will not bear the pressure of cylinders
without damage in color, while the soaking of the stems is sure to
weaken it. The experiments in India failed to distinguish between the
Indian hemp and Manila hemp plants, which belong to different families,
and require radically different treatment.</p>
<p>The islands of Leyte and Marinduque, and certain districts in the
large island of Luzon yield the finest quality of hemp. The province
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>of Albay, the leading hemp-district of Luzon,
cannot be surpassed in quantity and quality of yield, its annual
hemp-crop averaging about 20,000 tons. Before 1825 the demand was
little, and the hemp-yield insignificant. Since then, the growing
demand has greatly developed the culture, the crop of 1840 being about
8,500 tons, in 1880 about 50,000 tons. It has been steadily on the
increase.</p>

<p>The United States receives the greatest proportion of this product,

thither from the plantations.</p>

<h3 class="main">Experience of a Planter.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">For those that desire statistics, I may repeat the
statement made to me in person by an Albay planter. The plantation of
this gentleman, in which he had invested a capital of $60,000, embraced
1800 <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>acres, planted at the time of purchase with
shoots of two years&rsquo; growth, and therefore needing one year more
before cutting. There was a store-house on the estate capable of
holding 5000 piculs, or 695,000 pounds of hemp (a picul is 139 pounds).
The purchase also included a bale-press and shed, a plot prepared for
sun-drying, two horses, and a vehicle.</p>
<p>The working expenses of this plantation, including the various items
of salaries to overseers, clerks, and storekeepers, wages to natives,
living and traveling expenses of overseer, fire insurance, office
expenses, freight to Manila, loading, commission, storage, and minor
items, were $10,000. In this were included some loss by stealing, and
several hundred dollars loss by waste.</p>
<p>In one year the planter received in Manila $27,000 for his dried
bales of hemp-fibre, making a net profit of thirty per cent. on
invested capital. It must be remembered, however, that in Albay
province the conditions for the investor in abac&aacute;-planting are
of the best. Equal results cannot be expected elsewhere.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">What the Hemp Is Used For.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Manila hemp is principally used in the manufacture of
mats, sail cloth, and cordage. Out of the old ropes the well-known
stout brown wrapping-paper is made&mdash;the Manila paper of commerce.
In Paris the imported hemp-fibre is used in the manufacture of carpets,
tapestry, net-work, hammocks; and even in the making of bonnets.</p>
<p>The natives obtain small quantities of very fine hemp-fibre from the
carefully-selected edges of the petiole, or leaf-stalk, and from this
they weave an exquisite, fine, silky material, suitable for gowns. This
fibre is worth twice as much as first-class cordage hemp. The
difficulties with the weave lie in the fragility, and, consequently,
the frequent breakages of the thread; hence the expense of the
material. On one of the islands a fabric is made from fine hemp and
pine-leaf fibre. This the natives endeavor to sell to foreigners for
pure pi&ntilde;a, which is as fine and soft as Bengal muslin. The fraud
is detected by the lack of flexibility in the material, it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>having a horse-hair stiffness. Any one that has
ever touched a soft, silky, pine-leaf fibre handkerchief, for instance,
would easily distinguish the difference.</p>

alt="A Bamboo-bridge in Albay." width="720" height="459">
<p class="figureHead">A Bamboo-bridge in Albay.</p>
</div>
<p>Lastly, in enumerating the valuable qualities of manila hemp, I may
state that the poorer classes of the natives of the Philippine Islands
wear clothes that they manufacture from the ordinary fibre; and that
even the bags in which the fresh coffee-beans are sent from the islands
to foreign markets are made from the same material.</p>
<p>I may say, in concluding this subject, that hemp is the most
important article of Philippine product, and that its production is
capable of being greatly increased. The official documents that I have
examined in Manila show that within the last decade the United States
has received fully forty per cent. of all the hemp-product of the
islands. In the ten years previous to 1898 a single firm in Boston
bought 79,000 tons of hemp, paying for it an average price of 3 cents a
pound in the Manila market. During this period the total export of hemp
was 914,100 tons. The import to the United States during the same time
averaged in value $2,400,000 a year. A liberal and progressive
administration will soon increase this tenfold.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Cultivation of Tobacco, a State Monopoly.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The seed of the tobacco plant was introduced into the
Philippines from Mexico by Spanish missionaries. It is an annual, grows
to the height of five or six feet, and varies greatly in flavor, not
only in different provinces, but in different places in the same
province. Luzon has always been more directly under the control of the
Spaniards than any other part of the Archipelago. As it contains the
capitol&mdash;literally the seat of Government&mdash;it is from this
island that every unjust and cruel edict has proceeded since the time
of the conquest. Indeed, Spain has never tried to govern more than half
a dozen of the islands; and while all of the Philippines are nominally
under her suzerainty, there are at least two hundred of them filled
with fierce and intractable tribes&mdash;and these she has not even
explored. But it is Luzon that, from first to last, has felt most
heavily the weight of her iron hand. On that island, in 1781, the
cultivation of tobacco was formally declared a State monopoly.</p>
<p>This lasted just a year and a century. The Government, after long
debate on the subject, decided that, on the whole, it would be more
profitable and less troublesome to demand a high license, and place the
enterprise in the hands of private dealers.</p>

</div>
<p>The monopoly was accordingly abolished, December 31st, 1882. The
natives fought against this. They had suffered horribly from
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>State regulations. They feared to suffer more
from private persecution. The friars, however, the real rulers of the
Philippines, decided against the monopoly; and, notwithstanding that it
was the largest source of public revenue on the islands, it was
abolished.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="xd21e4011" class="div2 section"><span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Oppressive Conditions in Luzon.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">From 1781 to 1882, then, in Luzon the following
conditions prevailed: First, in the Philippines natives were never
allowed to own land,&mdash;the property of the State. By paying for the
privilege they might receive permission to cultivate the soil. During
the continuance of the monopoly, in certain districts in northern
Luzon, only tobacco plants were permitted to be placed in the ground.
Not one foot of his poor little plot could the native use for his own
subsistence. Moreover, he was forced to contract with the Government to
raise 4000 plants a year; not one leaf of which could he call his
own.</p>
<p>Every family was bound to produce a given quantity annually; while a
shortage in returns was punished with beating, fines, confiscation, or
imprisonment.</p>
<p>In some of the districts selected the islanders were too wild and
insubordinate to follow directions in the planting, the preparing, and
in the drying of the leaf. Emigrants were therefore sent from the
vicinity of Manila, and were provided with land, homes, food, and
clothing.</p>
<p>Their subsequent fate was pitiable. Spies of the Government visited
the native houses at all hours, in search of concealed tobacco. Every
nook and corner of the little dwelling would be ransacked time and
again, and the women of the family subjected to rude and insulting
personal inspection.</p>
<p>And these harassing visits were made at disquieting intervals;
sometimes two or three days in succession; so that the easy and
indolent Filipino was kept in haunting terror of incursions.</p>
<p>At the Government headquarters of the district, the dried leaves
were carefully examined by the Inspector. Those that he approved he
paid for; the rest were burned. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230"
href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span></p>
<p>If an Indian were caught smoking one of his own cigars, within a few
steps of his own airing-sheds, he was seized and fined. The offence,
arrest, and conviction cost him dear: about $8.00 if he were smoking a
cigar; about $2.00, if a cigarette.</p>

</div>
<p>In a country where the monotony of life is mitigated by the soothing
effects of the leaf, and where men and women smoke as
inevitably&mdash;and almost as naturally&mdash;as they eat, these
constant and harassing exactions became maddening. The burning of the
rejected bundles was felt to be especially cruel and unnecessary. But
the Inspector was inexorable.</p>
<p>All these combined causes, and particularly the insults to women,
frequently brought about bloody encounters between the people and the
servants of the State.</p>
<p>There are numberless cases where Indians live on the land cultivated
by their ancestors, and cling to it; and, in their ignorance, feel it
to be their own. The Government, however, with its usual <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>treachery, finally took advantage of this
attachment, and, while exacting full returns from the natives, paid
them only in part, or in depreciated currency.</p>

<h3 class="main">How Speculators Take Advantage of the Natives.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Sharpers from Manila made their way into the tobacco
districts as soon as this was known, buying large sums in Treasury
notes for small quantities of specie; and so needy were the natives,
and so rooted their distrust of Spain, that they made the exchange
eagerly, glad to get into their hands the smallest quantity of the
money they were familiar with&mdash;genuine gold.</p>
<p>Every effort was made to confine the growth of tobacco to certain
selected districts controlled by the State, but, in spite of this,
concealed plantations were continually being cultivated in remote
provinces, and a large body of picked men and many revenue cutters were
constantly in the employ of the Government. It was their duty to
discover and destroy these plantations, punish the growers, confiscate
the leaf, and break up the smuggling.</p>
<p>But, despite these precautions and drastic measures, the initiated
always knew where to obtain a good cigar for about one-fourth of what
was paid for it in a Manila shop. Expedition after expedition was sent
to distant islands, to discover and punish the growers and
manufacturers of illicit tobacco, and stubborn fights ensued, the
friars invariably being on the side of the natives.</p>
<p>These were the abuses and revolts that finally led to the abolition
of the monopoly.</p>
<p>Private enterprise in the islands has its own hard ways to
accomplish its own unscrupulous ends, and whether Company, individual,
or Government is in power, the result is always the same&mdash;the
native is cheated, suffers, is pushed to the wall.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Quality of Manila Tobacco.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Since 1882 it is a matter of common complaint that
there is not so much care taken in the preparing of the leaf: this
requires great skill and unwearied attention to detail, inasmuch, as if
overheated, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>or left too long in the airing-sheds, something
precious is lost in quality and in aroma.</p>
<p>Cuban cigars are not sold in the colony, and the old residents
believe the flavor of their own tobacco incomparable. The outside
world, however, gives the preference to the Cuban brand. Indeed, at one
time the Government tried to introduce seed from Cuba, but, owing to
mismanagement, the scheme failed. Such an inferior quality of leaf
sometimes finds its way into Manila, and is sold for such low prices,
that one wonders what profit there can be in cultivating it. This is,
of course, worked off on the poorer natives.</p>
<p>The tobacco trade is still a monopoly in Spain, and the Philippines
are under contract to provide the home factories with 98,000 cwt. of
dried leaf per annum. Enormous fortunes are made in a short time in
this product.</p>
<p>When the infamous Weyler was Governor-General of the Philippines,
his two brothers were in this business in Binondo. They went back to
Madrid in a few years, and lived like princes.</p>
<p>The fact remains, however, that while a very superior article of
cigar and cigarette is made in the factories of Manila and its
vicinity, if the colony wishes to compete with other countries, the
tobacco planters must raise the standard of quality all along the
line.</p>

<h3 class="main">Methods of Preparing the Tobacco Leaf.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are several large tobacco factories in Binondo,
the trading centre of Manila; one in particular employing <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e4076" title="Source: 15,00">15,000</span> men, women,
and children, at an average wage of 15 cents a day. The working hours
are from seven to twelve in the morning, and from two to five in the
afternoon. Just at sunset, I have often seen the operatives leave this
factory in droves, and thousands of them immediately plunge into the
waters of Manila Bay, where they swam about in the surf, rolling,
tumbling, and shouting like children.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Native Girls Making Manila Cheroots.</p>

<p>I have repeatedly gone through the factories, following the leaf
from bale to finish; and it is an interesting sight. Color and quality
are decided by a lightning expert, and quick and thorough <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span>is
the whole process, till the finished cigars are packed in cedar boxes,
labeled for the market. Cedar-wood seems part of the charm.</p>
<p>Innumerable efforts have been made to use other and less expensive
woods in packing, but without avail: either the cedar conserves the
aroma better, or, more likely, it adds a special quality of its own,
which, through long habit, the confirmed smoker finds indispensable to
his enjoyment.</p>

<p>The Escalante region is noted for the fine tobacco grown there,
though sugar, of course, is the most important crop. The tobacco is
rich-flavored, and by many experts is deemed the most desirable leaf in
all the Visayas.</p>
<p>But it is generally agreed that the best quality of Island tobacco
is that grown in the provinces of northern Luzon, the most valued
coming from Cagayan and La Isabela.</p>
<p>Old residents invariably prefer Island tobacco; but the English, as
the Americans, and the peninsular Spaniard choose, instead, the famous
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>Vuelto Abajo of Cuba, and think they get it.
Millions of &ldquo;Havana&rdquo; cigars, made of Philippine leaf, are
sold in Manila under the name of this brand. In fact, the two
styles&mdash;Manila and Cuban&mdash;are manufactured in almost equal
quantities, differing in size and shape, but not in quality. The
expert, at the selecting table, divides his heap into many different
colors. Only five, however, are known to the trade. They are: Maduro,
Colorado Maduro, Colorado, Colorado Claro, and Claro.</p>
<p>The filling of a cigar is called tripa, or tripe; the wrapper, capa,
or overcoat. From the factory I have mentioned, alone, a million and a
half of cigars are shipped to Europe every month. The strong, dark
brands go to Spain. England takes every kind. The lighter colors are
preferred in America.</p>
<p>Tobacco-leaves for cigarettes are cut into thread&mdash;generally
called &ldquo;long cut,&rdquo;&mdash;and the whole process of making is
done by one machine. I have seen nine of these hard at work, each
turning out 12,000 cigarettes a day, making 38,000,000 in a year.</p>

<h3 class="main">Smoking, a Universal Habit.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Smoking goes on in the Philippines everywhere but in
church&mdash;in the hotel dining-room as soon as coffee is served, and
at the theatre or opera while the audience is gathering, and between
the acts. Even your cab-driver will offer you a cigar, if he thinks you
have none. Spanish women of wealth and rank&mdash;grandmothers,
mothers, daughters, and nieces sit on the balconies of their beautiful
residences in the capital, puffing away at their cigarillos,&mdash;a
tiny brand made especially for feminine consumption; while in some
homes men and women help themselves from the same box.</p>
<p>It is an incongruous sight, and one hostile to the accepted ideas of
a splendid type of primitive man, to see in the depths of remote
provinces native men and women, young and old, of striking physical
proportions, the men nude but for the flimsy breech-clout, smoking away
at cigars, cigarettes, and even pipes; and at every possible and
impossible angle of incidence. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236"
href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span></p>
<p>For cigars and cigarettes have for many years been sold everywhere
throughout the colony,&mdash;in even the remotest hamlets.</p>
<p>Besides, considerable stimulus has been given to the smoking habit
in the wildest provinces by travelers, who, to ingratiate themselves
with the half-savage natives of distant provinces, or to keep them from
speculating whether one is a Spaniard or not, and thereby arousing
their ire, bountifully dispense cigars and cigarettes <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e4119" title="Source: whereever">wherever</span> they
go.</p>
<p>And so the dominant and absorbing habit of the Filipinos is to
smoke.</p>
<p>Indeed, the common habit of smoking makes it possible to realize the
Arabian Nights&rsquo; stories of fabulous fortunes made in the
Philippines in a short time from the cultivation, preparation, and
manufacture of the fragrant leaf.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Origin of the Industry.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the early part of the nineteenth century several
Spaniards began the cultivation of coffee in a little valley away at
the north end of Luzon. The trees they planted were the first coffee
plants ever known on the island. A small wild animal, somewhat like a
weasel, somewhat like a fox, began eating and scattering the growing
berries, until in this way myriads of the little creatures had
unwittingly sown coffee seeds over all the island.</p>
<p>Some of these original plants still bear fruit, thousands of pounds
being gathered from the wild bushes. Plantation owners in that
vicinity, the province of Batangas, have, indeed, assured me that the
trees possessed by their grandfathers are still vigorous; while it is
also a well-known fact that in many other coffee-producing colonies the
plants are quite exhausted by the end of the thirtieth year.</p>
<p>Manila coffee is highly prized in Spain and her dependencies. They
have, of course, nothing so rich in flavor as the Mocha bean of Arabia,
but a kind, called caracolillo, that resembles it in taste and in
shape. It has only one seed to the berry, while, on the other hand, all
other varieties have two.</p>
<p>The merchants in Manila are extremely cautious in their dealings
with the provincial planters, giving the preference to coffee from
Cavit&eacute;, Batangas, and La Laguna. In Mindanao coffee is sent to
the market without being looked over, the result being a distasteful
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>compound of good and bad beans. This is sold to
the unfastidious natives at very low prices, but is wholly unfit for
European consumption.</p>

<h3 class="main">Indifference of Coffee-planters.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Cavit&eacute; planters&mdash;whether Spaniard or
Indian&mdash;show an indifference to a dozen details that their
competitors in the other provinces named are extremely particular
about. They are careless in the selecting of sites for their
plantations, which should be on hilly ground; careless in the choice of
the soil, of the seed, in pruning, in attention to the ripe fruit; in
detaching the bean from its outer coating; and, above all, in many
places, careless to separate the good beans from the bad. All this is
due to the inertness of the planter and to the indolence of his
laborers.</p>

possibilities in that direction are simply incalculable.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Speculation in Coffee.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Coffee is a good deal of a speculation in the islands.
Collectors drive about paying for crops still ungathered. Moreover, if
the large <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>planters do not produce enough to fill their
contracts, they depend upon the small plots of the natives,&mdash;which
will account for much variety in the bean, and for the occasional
extremely-poor quality already spoken of. The money advanced is always
gauged by the price per picul that coffee brought the year before in
the Manila market.</p>
<p>For instance, if it then cost $12 a picul, $8 will be advanced to
the planter on the crops in the ground. The collector always tries to
protect himself by a pretty good margin. He occasionally loses,
however. In one case, some years ago, coffee advanced to $31 a picul,
and enormous fortunes were made.</p>
<p>Fluctuations are constantly occurring in the coffee market, owing to
the peculiar nature of the transactions, as purchases are invariably
made before the crop has come to fruition. But a startling rise like
the one mentioned, is unprecedented in the history of the trade, and is
hardly likely to occur again.</p>
</div>

<div id="xd21e4171" class="div2 section"><span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Methods of Cultivation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A coffee-site, as I have said, should be chosen on
high ground, and on the side of a hill; for the reason that, while the
body of the plant requires a great degree of moisture, which is given
by the heavy rains of the country, the roots, on the other hand, must
be kept dry.</p>
<p>The ground is cleared&mdash;generally by fire&mdash;and fenced in.
Like hemp, the coffee tree needs careful shading, and to insure this
the next process is to plant slips of the madre cacao, in straight
rows, about one Spanish yard apart. When these reach the height of
three feet, the coffee-shoots are placed at intervals in the holes
prepared for them, having been soaked for two or three days in
water.</p>
<p>As the plantation becomes too thick, trees and plants are
removed&mdash;care being taken, however, to preserve the symmetrical
appearance of the whole, as it is imperative for the health of the tree
that no coffee-shoots or branches should touch one another.</p>
<p>In its natural state, the tree grows to the height of twenty-five
feet, but constant pruning is necessary, and the tree, when properly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>cared for, is kept down to seven or eight feet.
Returns are expected four years after planting.</p>

<p class="figureHead">The Useful Buffalo: For All Hauling-purposes.</p>
</div>
<p>There are few things more beautiful than a well-ordered coffee
estate in full bloom. Straight and stately avenues cross each other in
every direction. The plant has long glossy leaves, like the laurel; the
blossoms are snowy-white, and in shape resemble the jasmine, and their
fragrance is exquisite; while overhead the madre foliage grows dense,
protecting the more delicate plant from too much sun, too pelting a
storm, too wild a blast. The fruit, when ripe, is of a dark scarlet
color, and the ordinary berry contains two seeds, glued together and
covered with a membrane. The mocha of Arabia and the caracolillo of
Manila are richer in flavor than the other varieties, and, as already
stated, have but one bean, thus differing in shape from those of the
ordinary berry. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241"
name="pb241">241</a>]</span></p>
<p>The neighborhood of Lipa is noted for its wealth and for many coffee
estates round about. A number of the planters there have sedulously
done all in their power to attain perfection in the growing, dressing,
sorting, and marketing of the bean. Along their own lines, too, they
have overcome obstacles, and have effected certain success. And some of
the estates are beautiful and most prosperously ordered. I have driven
through them and ridden over them, and have invariably admired them,
and, admiring, I have marveled at the landscape-gardening effects
produced on what was seemingly so commercial a basis. Ruskin&rsquo;s
own ideas of beauty in every-day life and in lowly occupation can not
find a more delightful and satisfying illustration than in the
environment in which masses of laborers delve and toil upon some of the
Lipa coffee estates.</p>
<p>In the Philippines the coffee berries are gathered by hand from the
trees,&mdash;men, women, and children assisting in the process. The
fruit is then put aside in heaps, and in a few days is washed. In this
way much of the pulp is detached and discarded. The remainder is placed
in a mortar and pounded until the clean bean emerges, which, in the
bulk, forms the coffee of commerce. This is sent, in coarse bags of
hemp, to Manila for sale.</p>
<p>The ripe berries, when sun-dried, lose over 50 per cent. of
moisture.</p>

<h3 class="main">Harsh Methods of the Government.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Government at Madrid, with its usual heavy,
tyrannous policy, has imposed extra licenses on the planting of coffee,
and laid a heavy import duty on the machinery lately introduced and
used to prepare the bean for market.</p>
<p>The formation of the Philippine Archipelago is peculiarly adapted to
the cultivation of coffee and hemp. To say it once more: Both need high
altitudes, and to be grown on the sides of hills or mountains. On most
of the islands a range runs north and south, rising sometimes to the
height of nine thousand feet.</p>
<p>The laborers on a coffee estate expect to receive one-half the
produce for their work in caring for the crop, which includes
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span>ploughing,&mdash;something essential to the
health of the tree,&mdash;cultivating, picking, and drying the fruit,
and preparing the bean for transport to Manila.</p>
<p>The hard methods of the Government regarding the coffee bean, the
difficulties of the grower in obtaining reliable assistance, and the
fluctuations of the trade will probably account for the small quantity
produced under Spanish auspices. The island of Negros alone is so
accessible that the coffee production there ought to be enormous. In
1897 the exportation amounted to about $250,000. Under almost any other
government it would have reached $3,000,000.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Areca Palm and the Betel Nut.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Every wild country, it appears, has its favorite
soporific, and in the Philippines the fruit of the areca palm is a
necessity to most of the natives, just as opium is to the average East
Indian, but it is far less deleterious. The manner of its use is as
follows: A slice of the nut is wrapped in a buyo leaf, covered with
lime, made from oyster shells, and then chewed. The whole is called
betel, and the betel-eater is constantly spitting what seems arterial
blood; this, together with the sanguinary appearance of his gums,
teeth, and lips, makes him disgusting to contemplate.</p>
<p>The areca palm for its nut, and the buyo palm for its leaf, are
carefully and extensively cultivated. The latter must be used fresh,
and quantities of the green leaves are sold in the markets daily. The
effects of betel-chewing seems to be similar to that of the coca of
Peru; in moderation, the stimulus to the stomach is excellent; and in
both cases it is possible to labor for hours without food, if only the
native&mdash;Philippine or Peruvian&mdash;has an ample supply of his
favorite drug. Temperate use of either is positively beneficial. Abuse,
in both cases, produces delirium and death.</p>

<p>There are nearly one thousand warehouses and retail shops in Manila
for the sale of the areca nut, or for the fresh buyo leaf and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>lime necessary in its preparation; or for the
slices wrapped and ready for immediate use. The buyo leaf is hot to the
taste. When bruised and placed on the wound it is an antidote to the
bite of the most venomous snakes. It is useful in cholera; and water in
which the leaf has been steeped, is used by mothers as an outside
application in cases of infant colic.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Nipa Palm and Nipa Wine.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The nipa palm looks like a gigantic fern. It grows in
swamps, and its leaves are deemed invaluable for the thatching of
native huts. A tall grass, called c&oacute;gon, is also used for this
purpose. From the fruit-stalks of the nipa a wine is distilled that is
a Government monopoly; and the art of manufacturing brandy from
sugar-cane seems to be aboriginal. The inhabitants of the most distant
islands and provinces have a patient, slow, inglorious way of making
their favorite drink. The fermented juice is boiled in four-gallon
jugs; the steam then escapes through bamboo pipes, is cooled, and
condensed by a primitive arrangement overhead, running water passing
through a hollow log,&mdash;and the liquor falls into another large
stone jug. It is extremely strong and pure, and small quantities of the
drink are not unhealthful. The natives of the Philippines, as I have
said so often, hate to trouble themselves about anything, and are
impatient of slow processes; they will, however, take infinite pains in
the distillation of sugar-cane brandy. The rewards, though slow, are
definite, enchanting, and, above everything else, personal.</p>

nowhere else; and none is to be compared to the apple, peach, grape,

<p>The <span class="corr" id="xd21e4254" title=

large as a pineapple, and has a delicious white pulp. It requires a
great deal of courage to open it, as the rough outside-skin has a
monstrous odor of decaying flesh.</p>
<p>The favorite fruit is the mango. Of this, quantities are partaken
daily in the season.</p>
<p>Guava, from which jelly is made, grows wild.</p>
<p>The pawpaw tree also grows wild, and is valuable to the natives. The
bruised leaves exude a saponaceous liquid, that is used in the washing
of clothes, and has the cleansing effect of soap. The fruit is cooling,
but tasteless. It is said to contain pepsin, and is used by invalids
with weak digestion.</p>
<p>Bananas are both wild and cultivated; seventy-seven varieties are
found on the islands. The fruit is a staple article of food; and a
cloth is woven from the fibre that natives make up into garments. A
coarse paper is also made of it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247"

<p class="first">A native cannot own land. He may hold it under certain
conditions. What these are in the tobacco districts has been stated.
The regulations outside these districts are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>He must plant useful trees, suitable to the soil; raise wheat, rye,
maize, vegetables, cotton, pepper; maintain every species of
appropriate cattle; keep fruit growing in his orchards and around his
house; have at least twelve hens, one cock, and a sucking pig. Failing
in these impossible conditions, the land may be confiscated at the end
of two years.</p>
<p>The missionaries have always helped the natives to divide their
farms, plan their cultivation, and garner their harvests; they
introduced the useful maize and wheat, as well as melons and
garden-truck&mdash;peas, beans, cucumbers, onions, and other
vegetables. Potatoes are very much in demand, but, so far, have not
been successfully cultivated; being literally what the Americans call
&ldquo;small potatoes and few in a hill.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Cotton is cheaply produced, and in quantities
sufficient to supply the domestic trade. There is no reason why it
should not be made a matter of large foreign export.</p>
<p>Indigo plants grow in the wildest luxuriance throughout the
Philippines. Owing to the richness of the soil but little labor is
required in their cultivation, and annual returns are expected of 50
per cent. on the capital employed. There are people now living
magnificently in Paris and Madrid that owe their revenues to indigo
plantations in the colony; the Alvarado family, for instance, whose
immense estate is on the island of S&aacute;mar, and whose income from
this source is nearly $55,000 a year.</p>
<p>There was once a prejudice against Manila indigo among European
purchasers. This, however, has been removed by improved processes and
greater care on the part of growers and manufacturers. The crops are
not so certain as those of hemp, tobacco, or coffee. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span>They

<h3 class="main">The Cocoa Industry.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Cocoa and chocolate are the product of the cacao tree,
introduced early in the history of the islands by missionaries from
Mexico. The fruit is red in color and shaped like a large cucumber. The
beans, or kernels, are arranged in regular rows through the pulp,
varying in size and in number. They average twenty to the single fruit,
and generally have the size, and always the appearance, of almonds,
with hard skins. They are also very bitter. Whether dried in the sun or
roasted in ovens, the process must be done as soon as the fruit is
gathered, else the flavor of the kernel is injured. The beans are very
oily, and in manufacturing cocoa much of the fat is extracted. This
makes the drink more suitable for children and invalids.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e4292width" id="p248"><img src="images/p248.jpg"
alt="&ldquo;La Belle Chocolati&egrave;re&rdquo; of Luzon." width="428"
height="531">
<p class="figureHead">&ldquo;La Belle Chocolati&egrave;re&rdquo; of
Luzon.</p>
</div>
<p>To make chocolate, the beans are dried, the skins removed, and the
mass is pounded in a mortar, then placed upon a rolling board and
rolled. Quantities of sugar are added to neutralize the bitterness of
the kernel, with vanilla to give the whole flavor. This makes a paste
that is a great favorite with all classes of Spaniards <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>and
natives, both as a confection and when made into a beverage; yet but
little more of the fruit is grown on the islands than is necessary for
home consumption. The dried bean is safe as an export, but the cacao
tree has many enemies; and when the crop has come to ripening, in spite
of threatened disease and destroying vermin, it may be ruined by a
tempest in a single hour. These vicissitudes discourage the planter,
who seldom tries to do more than secure enough of the cacao bean for
family use. The trees are usually planted in gardens near the house,
and the chocolate-paste is made at home. A small quantity of the bean
is sent annually to Spain; and there is a chocolate factory in Manila
for the benefit of those that do not care to trouble themselves with
either the growth of the fruit or the preparation of the kernel. The
oil of the cocoa is used also for lighting the houses and streets.</p>
<p>It is impossible to find better chocolate than that made by the
friars of the Philippines. Special pains are taken with the cacao tree,
which is planted in the orchards and gardens of the monasteries, and in
the manufacture of the paste and in the making of the beverage. Care
must be used in the selection of soil and locality; the tree must be
shaded by the taller banana; the planter must be able to risk the loss
of an occasional harvest, caused by vermin, disease, or tempest; and in
good years the planter will get a return of 90 per cent. on his
capital. The fact remains, however, that few colonists are willing to
take chances in a crop, that, at the last minute, can be easily
ruined.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Traffic in Birds&rsquo; Nests.</h3>

<p class="first">The Philippine Islands are rich in growths that would
seem strange to an American&mdash;edible birds&rsquo;-nests, roots,
nuts, grasses, fruits, and the like. The bird&rsquo;s nest is sold in
large quantities to the Chinese, who make a soup of it,&mdash;nauseous,
indeed, to foreigners. It is built by a little creature resembling the
swallow; is pasty-white in appearance, dotted with red spots. The nests
are found high up, in almost inaccessible caves, on cliffs above the
sea. Nest-gathering is an occupation by itself, very dangerous, and
followed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>by natives of only extreme hardihood and
agility. The birds are robbed of their nests as soon as they are
completed, and this first gathering is sold to the Chinese at enormous
prices. The bird patiently builds another home, and is again despoiled.
The second gathering, however, is deemed second-class in the market;
and the third gathering is even more inferior. And &rsquo;tis only the
approach of the rainy season that protects the bird in the laying of
its eggs and in the care of its young.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Huge Forests.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are great forests of costly woods in the colony,
mahogany, sapan-wood, log-wood, iron-wood, ebony, and cedar; beside
fifty varieties not known to European markets, but eagerly sought for
by merchants from China. The cedar is almost exclusively used in making
cigar boxes; and I have seen beautiful knotted and polished war clubs
of iron-wood used by the remoter savages in their battles with other
tribes; they are as black as ebony, and nearly as hard as steel. These
various woods yield logs from eighteen to seventy feet in length. The
molave is especially valuable: the sea-worm cannot bore it, the white
ant eat it; nor is it affected by water or by climate. It is used for
the frames of vessels, and would be unsurpassed for railroad ties,
being practically invulnerable.</p>
<p>The palma brava is used in the making of bridges, piles, and
piers&mdash;wherever, in short, resistance to water is necessary.</p>
<p>Lanete-wood is useful in carving and in the making of musical
instruments, or elsewhere where delicacy is required, as well as
strength.</p>
<p>From sapan a rich crimson dye is extracted. This is obtained by
cutting the smaller branches into little pieces and soaking them
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>in boiling water. This dye is much esteemed, but
is not so permanent as that made from cochineal.</p>

some exquisite pink, red, yellow, and veined varieties, capable of high
polish, and suitable for veneering and for dye-woods. The saps of many
trees, also, give a hard, durable glaze.</p>
<p>Magnificent orchids abound in all parts of the Philippines. One
specimen was recently sold for $500. And there are rubber trees that
have hardly been worked, but have, nevertheless, a future of great

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Bamboo Plant and its Uses.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The most beautiful plant in the colony is bamboo. It
grows everywhere except in marshy places&mdash;on the hills, along the
banks of rivers, in open spaces, and in woods. Groups of bamboos are
invariably cultivated by the natives in the vicinity of their homes.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=
"pb253">253</a>]</span>It has a light, feathery, tufted top, that waves
in the slightest breeze and gives a spirited look to the landscape. It
frequently grows to the height of fifty or sixty feet, is from five to
eight inches in diameter, and strongly jointed, every joint
strengthened by an inside web.</p>
<p>There are also many smaller kinds.</p>
<p>The plant is constantly propagated by the natives from young shoots;
for bamboo-sticks always bring their price in Manila markets, according
to size and season. There are several varieties; and the uses to which
they are put are endless, the wood being tough, flexible, and
elastic.</p>
<p>From bamboo-sticks huts, houses, and churches are made; and even
roofed and thatched. For the latter, however, nipa palm and
c&oacute;gon grass are preferred. Bridges are constructed of them
several hundred feet in length, over which a drove of elephants could
safely cross; they are used in the making of furniture, walls,
flooring, rafts, scaffolding, carts, baskets, vessels to contain
liquid, and measures for wheat, organs, and small instruments, and
every kind of household utensil used by the natives. They are used,
also, for weapons, for cordage, for hats, for mats, for palings, for
carrying poles, for blowers to a furnace, and for condensing-pipes in
making brandy,&mdash;and for a hundred other articles of amusement or
convenience.</p>
<p>Bamboo-leaves are eaten by horses and cattle, and its tender shoots
by man. In one variety of the cane a stone is occasionally found. This
the Indians believe will heal sickness. In another kind is a white
substance used to allay inflammation of the eye. This disease is very
common in the colony, owing to the intensity of the sun-rays.</p>
<p>The rattan, or calamus family, is very much like the bamboo, and its
varieties are only a little less useful. One kind, the bojo, is used
for much the same things that the lighter bamboo is.</p>

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name=

rope, cords, or cable; to bind hemp-bags, sugar-bales, and bundles; to
lash together whatever breaks down or gives way, in house, harness,
carriage, cart, machinery, or package; in the city street, in the
country, on the mountain, in the wilderness. The thickest bejuco is
used for rafts and cables, and, in conjunction with bamboo, for the
making of suspension bridges. And the delicate fibres are woven into
cloth, and even made into hats and cigar cases.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Useful Cocoanut Palm.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Cocoanut plantations are among the surest sources of
revenue in the Philippines. The fruit is in demand in every market in
the world&mdash;as much so as oranges and lemons; and every part of the
tree can be sold. It thrives best on sandy soil, near the sea-shore,
and cocoanut-groves are expected to produce a profit of $250 an acre
annually.</p>
<p>In many provinces this palm is cultivated for the oil only, which is
then used either at home or is shipped to Europe. In the European
climate it is solid and is made into soap and candles. In the islands
the heat reduces it to a liquid, which is used for oiling machinery,
for lighting, and for cooking purposes. The nightly terror of the
region is a possible impending earthquake, and so in every house or hut
a tiny light burns from dark to dawn: a glass is half-filled with
water; on top is poured a small quantity of cocoanut oil, and in this
floats a wick, protected by a strip of tin. This arrangement has the
illuminating qualities of a brilliant firefly, but in cases of illness
or fright other lamps can be lighted quickly, and the panic of darkness
averted.</p>
<p>The majority of the inhabitants use cocoanut oil from reasons of
economy. The factories are small bamboo huts, and the process
primitive. The nuts are first dried, then halved and scraped,&mdash;an
easy process while the pulp is fresh. The mass is then pressed, to
express the oil, and the refuse boiled in order to obtain what is left
of the fatty substance. This is skimmed off. The whole is then packed
into kegs, and is ready for the markets of Manila or Madrid. The meat
of the nut is eaten as food by the natives, or made into sweets. The
milk, or water, is a refreshing and harmless drink, and makes good
vinegar also. The shell is carved into household utensils, and when
burnt makes a valuable dye. Every part of the tree is used. The native
dwells in a house made of the trunk and thatched with the leaves. From
it he obtains light, fire, rope, brushes, mats, furniture, clothing,
and, in fact, all the necessaries of life. In Europe and America the
coir, or outer <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>covering of the cocoanut shell, is made into
ropes and cocoa-matting.</p>
<p>Besides all this, the sap of the tree forms a delightful beverage,
called tuba. Incisions are made high up in the flowering stalk, and
underneath these cuts, vessels are hung to the tree, in order to catch
the liquor as it falls. This is removed at sunrise and sunset, and is
served fresh at the different houses. For it there is a daily demand.
The dealer, too, has it for sale in the market-place.</p>

<p class="figureHead">The Young Proprietor of a Cocoanut Grove

</div>
<p>A distilled wine is also made from this, called cocoa-wine. Tuba
trees are never used for fruit, as the loss of the sap deprives them of
their producing-power. And tuba-gathering is extremely dangerous. The
natives are obliged to climb to a great height to make the incisions
and gather the liquor, and a false step means certain death.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Government is very jealous of foreign growers.
There is a well-known case of a young Englishman that invested in a
cocoanut grove, a few years ago, not far from Manila. He was ruined in
a short time by taxes and exactions&mdash;on the score that he was not
a native. The real reason, however, was the fear that his success would
draw round him a British colony.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Spaniards and natives find no difficulty to
obtain concessions from the Government, under promise of cultivating
the land so taken. The regulations are so vague or so impossible, that
they are inevitably broken. The proprietor, too, is never sure of his
land: it can be forfeited by disobedience; and lawsuits are constantly
going on between the individual and the State.</p>
<p>This condition of affairs is of course annoying to everyone
concerned, yet no one ever thinks of changing the laws. To a Spaniard,
what was good enough for his grandfather is quite good enough for
himself.</p>

<p>The early missionaries from Mexico were of the greatest benefit to
the Filipinos, both in the religious and in the practical affairs of
life. They introduced the use of wheat and maize, taught the natives
how to cultivate these articles of food, and, when ripe, how to make
them into bread. But there were many stubborn prejudices to overcome;
and for a long time wheat was eaten by the natives only in the holy
wafer used in the sacrament of the Church.</p>
<p>Now, wheat-patches are common, and in many districts maize is as
much a staple article of food as rice is in others, and roasted ears of
corn are sold as a delicacy in the markets. There are three crops of
maize grown in a year, but only for family use.</p>
<p>The missionaries also introduced the art of weaving, and all through
the islands a primitive bamboo-loom is one of the commoner implements
of the smallest hut. Here are woven fabrics <span class=

cotton, silk, hemp, bamboo, and pi&ntilde;a,&mdash;the fibre of the

pure pineapple-leaf fibre, called jusi. This is durable and almost

thread, that, in weaving, it is protected by gauze from the gentlest
breeze. The costliness of the material, therefore, is due to the
difficulties of the weaver and to the time and patience necessary to
produce even a single inch.</p>
<p>The missionaries, as well, taught the native the arts of living; of
being more comfortable in his house, and out of it; of making bricks
and tiles, and of building and adorning churches. And <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>thus
they stood between an exacting Government and the helpless natives, and
were often the only Providence of which the latter were aware.</p>
<p>Herbs and medicinal plants abound in the islands. The bark of the
dit&aacute; tree greatly resembles that known as Peruvian Bark, and is
used by the natives to reduce fever. From it an alkaloid is extracted
that is called by Manila chemists, dita&iuml;ne. Its effects are like
those produced by swallowing quinine, only not so marked.</p>
<p>A perfume called Ylang-Ylang, is made from the flowers of a tree of
that name that grows in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Large quantities of wax are found there, and are used in the
functions of the Church. Indeed, the poor priests constantly gather
candle-ends at the close of each service, and sell them to be
remoulded. The small sums of money thus gained are deemed a part of
their perquisites.</p>

<h3 class="main">Early Search for Gold.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Mining for gold was unquestionably practiced in the
Philippines long before the time of Magellan, and incredible stories
were told by Spanish conquerors of the rich deposits on the islands,
and of the weight and beauty of the bracelets, necklets, and anklets of
pure metal worn by the natives. But the cruelty and robberies of Mexico
and Peru were repeated there, and the Indians yielded their jewels and
hoards to the ruthless conqueror.</p>
<p>Galleon after galleon sailed to Spain laden with the precious dust,
and enormous rewards were bestowed upon pilot and captain that should
convoy the treasure safely home. Winds, waves, and rocks were not the
only enemies of the Spanish mariner, either. England has always had a
hankering for the Philippines, and her fleets accordingly went out of
their way many a time to despoil Spain. In his voyage round the world,
Sir Francis Drake seized two prize-ships filled with island-gold, in
token of whose riches one of his cruisers swaggered into the port of
London with damask sails and silken cordage. And in the eighteenth
century Anson&rsquo;s fleet hovered for years in the neighborhood of
the Philippines, a rich prize occasionally his reward. <span class=

<h3 class="main">The Mining Laws and Methods of the Colony.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The mining laws of the colony are extremely liberal in
character; almost any one&mdash;Spaniard, native, or
foreigner&mdash;that discovers a mine, and reports it to the
Government, is allowed to work it. Certain regulations exist, however,
that must be strictly observed. The mine has to be worked
uninterruptedly eight months of the year; no less than eight laborers
shall be employed at a time; and it must be under the inspection of the
Mining Department of the State.</p>
<p>The gold of these islands is produced by washing and digging. The
tools that the natives use&mdash;a washing-board and a wooden
bowl&mdash;are of great antiquity, and are invariably seen among the
household utensils in the gold regions. Large deposits of gold are
found in the beds of streams, and sometimes, after heavy rains, grains
of the precious metal may be picked up in the streets of the small
villages.</p>
<p>No Indian ever works systematically, or lays up anything for a
possible future time of need. The tax-gatherer is at hand, and in a
desultory way the native manages to get sufficient of the wherewithal
to satisfy his greed. Or a holiday approaches, and there must be a few
dollars to gamble away in the cock-pit. All this is done in the
intervals of other work,&mdash;the planting of his own land, or the
gathering of the rice-harvest for his employer. The gold lies about
him, upon which he can draw at pleasure for his extra relaxations or
needs. It is always there, has always been, will always be there. Why
should he trouble himself further?</p>
<p>Mining, scientifically considered, as carried on in Europe and in
America, is unknown in the Philippines. Nevertheless, from the first,
so far as draining is concerned, operations have been conducted on
sound engineering principles. The natives cling to ancient customs, and
reject explosives of every sort, using instead the work of myriads of
human hands; but they have been rewarded by obtaining thousands of
ounces of gold.</p>

<p class="figureHead">A Group of Tagalogs Employed by a Mining

</div>
<p>For instance, in draining the mines, the shafts are filled with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>men that bail out the water with small buckets
made of palm leaf, and holding about two gallons. These are passed from
hand to hand, and this seems to serve their purpose quite as well as a
more modern method. To an Anglo-Saxon the slowness of the process
would, of course, be intolerable. The natives wash the river-sands, or
grind the alluvial deposits between stones. In the latter instance the
whole mass is thrown into grates, when the metal sinks to the bottom.
In the mines the rocks are broken with hammers, and the quartz
pulverized between mill-stones; then dissolved. By this means the gold
is separated.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of one province cut a basin in the top of a mountain
and conducted water to it through canals of palm-leaf. As they dug, the
stratifications of gold revealed themselves and the quartz was
detached. In another province a hillock has been cut down to sea-level,
and large quantities of paying quartz must have been obtained, as the
natives never work long without reward.</p>
<p>Mambulao is on the island of Luzon. It means in Bicol language,
&ldquo;the place of gold.&rdquo; Here is an abandoned mine, worked by
the ancient methods. The records say that, in its time, it produced
weekly sales of gold, amounting to one thousand ounces.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Spaniards have conducted their mining
operations without enterprise and without ingenuity, and during the
last twenty-five years they have spent nearly a million and a half
dollars, with results that are totally unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this state of affairs: The gold mines
are mostly in remote provinces of the colony, and there are no
practical roads. The natives that are employed&mdash;because they live
in the vicinity of the mines&mdash;are half-subjected, totally
uncivilized, and frequently nomadic. They accordingly resent
interference with property that they deem their inalienable rights. And
in this they are supported by the friars: they also dislike change.</p>
<p>Since 1894 the agents of the Philippines&rsquo; Mineral
Syndicate&mdash;an English concern&mdash;have been vigorously exploring
for gold and the other metals, and in time American capital and
intelligence <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name=
"pb264">264</a>]</span>will probably do what Spanish ignorance and
inertness have failed to accomplish.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Where the Precious Metal is Found.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Till now, much of the gold found has been near the
coast, and accessible. The principal districts are Mambulao, in Luzon,
the islands of Cion, Mindoro, Mindanao, and Panaon, a small island
north of Mindanao. It is a well-known fact that the natives in the
interior of Luzon, a district only partly explored, traffic in gold.
And it is believed that the mountains in the centre of the island are
the sources of the alluvial deposits so freely gathered. In the
districts mentioned there is not a stream&mdash;however
small&mdash;that does not bear in its sands some evidence of the
presence of gold; and heavy nuggets are occasionally brought in from
the interior.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e4485width" id="p264"><img src="images/p264.jpg"
alt="Another Glimpse of the Great Stone-bridge." width="695" height=
"421">
<p class="figureHead">Another Glimpse of the Great Stone-bridge.</p>
</div>
<p>For the present, however, only the edges of the gold districts can
be worked. The absence of roads must long prove an insuperable obstacle
even to English and American capital and inventiveness. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span>To
the Indians this is no obstacle at all. They march along contentedly,
in single file, cutting their way with bowie-knives through dense and
almost impenetrable forests, their burden the primitive instruments of
their ancestors; their power lying in numbers, and in the invincible
strength of the naked hand.</p>
<p>But modern methods require machinery, and machinery requires roads
for its transportation and for bridges, and for all the costly
engineering staff and outfit. The proper development of the gold
districts of the islands will therefore, necessarily, be a thing of the
future. English or American enterprise, if devoted to this purpose,
must find its reward near the coast, and in the vicinity of harbors and
navigable rivers.</p>
<p>So far, gold is known only in placer-deposits, and these not very
rich, as compared with the golden sands of California or the gravel
pits of Alaska. Personally, I know but little about these gold gravels,
having seen only some of their results. They are so widely distributed,
and are worked in so desultory a manner, that their actual richness is
a matter of guess-work.</p>
<p>But, as is well known, the gold of streams comes from quartz-veins
in the mountains, which have been worn away and washed down by the
rains during the long ages, then carried down stream, with the mud and
the gravel of the rock d&eacute;bris, and gradually sinking to the
bottom. There may be rich rock-veins in the interior, at the head of
those gold-paved water channels. But I have made no search for these
mother-beds; neither have the Spanish.</p>
<p>Many Chinese enter the gold districts, penetrating into the most
distant parts, and exchanging their wares for gold, which is sent to
China in ways known to themselves alone. Paracale is a prosperous
village in the interior of Luzon, and &ldquo;Paracale&rdquo; gold is
well known in Manila on account of its shape,&mdash;the metal being
melted in shells, that give it form. Every small shell bears the mark
of the Chinese testing-auger; its fineness seldom exceeds sixteen
carats. Paracale is near the Mambulao district, already mentioned, and
is famous for its abandoned mine and for its gold-washings.

<h3 class="main">The Whole Country a Virgin Mine.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In fact, the whole country waits in virgin richness to
be exploited by a wide-awake people, and now the outcome of the land
falls into the hands of the Americans. In my own mind I am convinced
that gold is to be had in paying quantities for the mining, if hunted
for by some of that enterprising people that have recently dug up such
wealth in the frozen river-beds of the Yukon. Spain held California for
centuries, and picked up not even an ounce of gold from its broad
acres. The Americans, on the other hand, found it teeming with gold;
and in the first year of their possession too.</p>
<p>The same may be said of Alaska. Russia found it hardly worth the
keeping, and sold it at a low price to the United States. To-day it
could not be bought back for a hundred times the price paid for it.</p>
<p>Such may prove to be the case with the Philippines. They wait to be
exploited. Spain has held them for centuries, and knows next to nothing
about them. I venture to affirm that the United States would not hold
them ten years before they would be veritable mines of wealth. I am
satisfied, too, that they are far richer in gold, iron, coal, and some
other minerals than is suspected. But this can be proved only by a
stirring people, that will cut their way through the tropical jungles,
explore the hill-country from base to summit, and cover the islands
with a network of rails,&mdash;the iron nerves of modern
enterprise.</p>
<p>The country sadly needs opening up and developing. It is running
over with rich possibilities. But it wants brains and hands. I know
that it can be made enormously prolific if proper energy be devoted to
the task.</p>

<h3 class="main">Precious Stones and Iron.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">An English engineer, in the employ of the Mineral
Syndicate, told me that in some gold alluvial-deposits brought to him
by the aborigines in the interior of Luzon, he had discovered small
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=
"pb269">269</a>]</span>stones. Subsequent investigations and tests
proved them to be rubies and hyacinths. Granted. But I have never heard
of precious stones outside of that district; nor do I believe they
exist in any quantity there.</p>

<p>There is plenty of iron, of excellent quality, in Luzon and in the
other islands. There are some deserted mines near Manila that were once
worked by the Government; but they have been idle for more than a
century. About the year 1750, by promises of great concessions to the
State, a Spaniard named Salyado obtained possession of a large iron
mine in the district of M&oacute;rong. Finding the Indians too indolent
to help him, he hired Chinese. He was then attacked by the Church, on
the score of employing infidel labor, and eventually he was obliged to
send his workmen back to China at his own expense. He was further
refused a market for his ore, because, it was said, it was the result
of infidel labor. Hence, he found himself ruined. The Government thus
adopted a plan to get the valuable mine into its own hands again, after
which its interest ceased.</p>
<p>Near Angat, early in this century, two Englishmen introduced
expensive machinery, and proceeded to mine for iron. They were so
cheated by the natives, and received so little in return for the large
sums expended, that they simultaneously committed suicide, by blowing
out their brains.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Copper is found in many parts of the Philippines, but
in very small quantities. In the mountain-ranges in the centre of
Luzon, however, deposits have been worked by the natives from a time
long before that of the Spaniards. They soften the rocks by wood fires
and then make excavations, separating the ore according to quality.
Their furnaces are holes lined with clay, and they use blowers of
bamboo to produce the necessary draught.</p>

their enterprise collapsed. The Indians still work them on a small
scale.</p>
<p>The engineers of the syndicate also found a very curious deposit of
copper in one of their concessions. This consists of round or
pear-shaped nuggets of the metal, with traces of both gold and silver
in their composition.</p>

<h3 class="main">Other Minerals and the Coal-fields.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Archipelago is said to be of volcanic formation,
and unlimited quantities of sulphur exist on many of the islands. Red
lead, silver, and gypsum were also found, and marble, capable of a high
polish.</p>
<p>There are extensive coal fields in Luzon and Ceb&uacute;, but it is
mostly of a poor quality, known by the trade as lignite. It is used in
coaling steamers, but not when long voyages are to be taken. Five
thousand tons per month could be procured in Ceb&uacute; alone, if
carriage were provided; yet nearly all the coal used is imported from
Australia.</p>
<p>A few years ago an American vessel was wrecked on the coast of
Mindoro. The captain and his men crossed to a port on the east coast,
over the mountains, living for seventeen days in the woods on nuts.
They reported great ledges of out-cropping coal in the hill-country,
and that thousands of tons had broken off and fallen to the foot of the
cliffs. The Spanish Government immediately confiscated the
lands;&mdash;and that was the last of the matter.</p>
<p>The coal field in Luzon lies in the southern part. A lead cropping
out at Gatho is from ten to twenty feet in thickness. This has proved
useful for steamboat service. The coal of Ceb&uacute; was first
discovered in 1827. It is found on the western slopes of the island,
and seemingly extends under the straits, appearing again on the eastern
slopes of the neighboring island, Negros. At least five beds have been
opened, which vary in quality and thickness; but exploration has not
been actively conducted.</p>
<p>Once more: The Spanish masters of the island have done little
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>to develop its mineral resources. It is
therefore impossible to say how rich it may be in coal. The find
reported by the American captain lies fallow, no effort having been
made even to prove its truth or to test its value. It was in the
mountainous interior, and, hence, would demand railroads and other
public improvements for its working, and the Spanish find it more
convenient to enjoy life lazily in Manila than to disturb their easy
existence by any such activity.</p>
<p>To those minerals mentioned I may add quicksilver, lead, sulphate,
and vermilion. As yet, the veins of lead and quicksilver have yielded
no results of value, and probably they possess none. But they have been
discovered in many localities and may be found in others; possibly,
too, of greater richness.</p>
<p>Perhaps the iron of the Philippines offers the best opening for
enterprise. As I have said, it occurs in many sections, and is of
excellent quality, pure and rich, but it was actually worked a century
ago with more energy than it is to-day. It is capable of yielding great
results to an enterprising people. The Philippines fell like a rich
jewel into the hands of Spain, but have been left by them in their
uncut state. They remain like a rough diamond, needing only the work of
the lapidary&mdash;America&mdash;to show to the world their full beauty
and value.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Useful Buffalo, and Other Domestic Animals.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Among the domesticated animals of the Philippines the
buffalo stands first; the delight and pride of the low-class native
being in his carabao, as he designates this animal. It is easily
domesticated, and is regarded with affection by its owner, being a very
different animal from the wild buffalo of the Asiatic and African
wilds,&mdash;one of the most savage of beasts.</p>
<p>At six years of age the tamed buffalo is put to work as a draught
animal, and when twelve years old it remains strong enough for five
years more of light labor. The buffalo is the plough-horse of the
islands. The plough is a very primitive affair&mdash;a heavy stick of
wood sharpened to a point at one end, with a beam attached by rattan
thongs, about two feet above the point to which the buffaloes are
hitched, and with a handle for the ploughman at the right end,
consisting of a round bar of wood, inserted in an auger hole.</p>
<p>The buffalo is amphibious in habit, and if left to itself will spend
a considerable part of the time in mud and water. It is capable of
keeping its head under water for two minutes at a time, exploring the
bottom of streams or pools for certain favorite plants. To it a daily
mud-bath is one of the necessities of life. He will fling himself on
his side in the mire, and shuffle round and round until he is covered
to the eyes with a mortar-like substance. When he has <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>dried himself in the sun he looks like a huge
clay image. This strange habit is not without its useful purpose.
Millions of stinging flies swarm among the rank vegetation of his
habitat, and till his mud-coat peels off the animal is impregnable to
their vicious attacks.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e4591width" id="p274"><img src="images/p274.jpg"
alt="A Buffalo in Harness: Harrowing the Soil." width="656" height=
"581">
<p class="figureHead">A Buffalo in Harness: Harrowing the Soil.</p>
</div>
<p>At work in the field he has certain feathered
companions,&mdash;usually five or six white herons,&mdash;that follow
him and feed on the worms and insects that his heavy tread brings to
the surface. A more friendly attendant is a small black bird, that hops
on the back of the great creature, and cleanses its ears of the vermin
that harbor there.</p>
<p>By the native owner the buffalo is treated with the utmost kindness,
a warm affection existing between the family and their patient,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name=
"pb275">275</a>]</span>docile laborer. Easy to train, and slow in
movement, it can be guided by a child three years old, and will move or
halt with readiness at the call of any of the family. Yet, strong as it
is, it cannot work for more than two hours without rest, and cannot
exist at a distance from streams.</p>
<p>Epidemic diseases sometimes break out among these animals and
destroy thousands of them. An old acquaintance of mine once lost in
this way nearly the whole of his live-stock in one season. Buffaloes
are not much needed in the hemp districts, where there is no ploughing
done, but are very necessary on the sugar plantations. Their price
varies accordingly. Wild ones, when caught young, are easily tamed and
trained by kindness, which the low-class native bestows freely.
Buffalo-hunting is very dangerous; for the animal in his native jungle
fights to kill or be killed; therefore, only the calves are captured
alive. Buffalo-meat makes excellent food, and its flesh, cut into
strips, and sun-dried, is much relished by the natives.</p>
<p>Horses are not native to the islands. The ponies that are found
there in large quantities are descended from the Andalusian horse and
the Chinese mare. They are swift and strong when cared for, but are
treated with horrible cruelty by the natives. These ponies, having an
Arab strain, are sensitive and nervous, easily guided by kindness;
whereas, on the other hand, they are infuriated by mismanagement. The
native riders often first goad them to madness and then punish them
viciously. This seems to arise more from a misunderstanding between the
two animals than from definite cruelty on one hand and obstinacy on the
other; and the contests witnessed daily in the streets of Manila are
not more painful than ridiculous.</p>
<p>The oxen sold in Manila markets do not yield very palatable beef,
being fattened on an herb that they are very fond of, but that gives to
the flesh a taste the reverse of agreeable.</p>
<p>In fact, neither fish, flesh, nor fowl has the same taste as those
of Europe and America, and newcomers to Manila have to acquire a taste
for these viands. Of course they are all right with those &ldquo;to the
manner born.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276"
name="pb276">276</a>]</span></p>
<p>Sheep are not indigenous to the soil, and do not thrive there,
languishing and dying within a few months.</p>
<p>The other domestic animals include goats, dogs, cats, pigs, monkeys,
and the ordinary fowls. The dogs and cats are of inferior breed, a
peculiarity in the cats being twisted tails. Among the viands that
foreigners seem to approve, is stewed monkey, but the natives will not
touch it except as a medicine, they deeming it of value in cutaneous
diseases.</p>

<h3 class="main">Reptiles, Bats, and Insects.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Reptiles and insects abound both in the jungles and in
the villages. In the latter they are, indeed, more numerous than is
agreeable to strangers. Among them are lizards, frogs, snakes,
centipedes, tarantulas, spiders of great size, hornets, beetles, ants,
and myriad other inmates of the minor world. The snakes while usually
harmless are not always so; one species,&mdash;the manapo,&mdash;found
in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=
"pb277">277</a>]</span>rice-fields, haunts the mud and the tall
rice-blades; its bite is fatal if not immediately cauterized. Leeches
are numerous in swamps and stagnant pools, and one tiny species, found
in dense forests only, has the disagreeable habit of leaping from the
trees upon passers-by, and at once beginning its blood-imbibing
habit.</p>
<p>Boa-constrictors are the giant members of the serpent family. They
are rare, and when caught are caged. Large as they are, little dread is
felt of them, they being far less dangerous than the manapo, the small
tenant of the rice-fields.</p>
<p>Bats are numerous, and some of them are of enormous size, measuring
five feet from tip to tip of the wings, and with a body almost as large
as a cat. One of these uncanny creatures, gone astray from its native
haunts, flew into the dining-room of a Manila hotel once where I was
dining. Its appearance was appalling: women shrieked and fainted, men
rolled under the tables, and an earthquake could hardly have made more
commotion. These huge bats are much hunted by Europeans, and their soft
skins are eagerly purchased by those that are returning home.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Philippines abound in game; deer and wild boars
being plentiful; while the game-birds include pheasants, snipe,
pigeons, woodcock, ducks, and other water-fowl. There are also hawks,
cranes, herons, parrots, parroquets, and many species peculiar to the
islands. Among the latter, we are told of a small black bird of the
swallow-kind that makes its nest in the tails of wild horses,&mdash;a
story more easily told than believed. Other fables concerning birds are
extant, one describing the &ldquo;solitary&rdquo; bird, which dies when
captured; one, the calayo, which has a large, transparent bill, and
crows like a cock; one, the bocuit, a bird of seven colors and the
sweetest of notes. There is a curious pigeon with a crimson spot on the
breast, which looks like a blood-stain from a wound.</p>
<p>Of aquatic creatures, tortoises are of considerable commercial
importance. They march in from the sea in great numbers, and the
natives turn them on their backs to prevent them from escaping,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>leaving them in this helpless state until they
are ready to remove them.</p>
<p>Quantities of small fish are caught in the rice-paddy fields when
they are flooded; and the rich Indians are fond of a curious kind of
beetle found in stagnant waters, which will bring in the markets, in
the season, as high as fifty cents a dozen. They eat many things that
would be repulsive to a foreigner.</p>

<p>Among the lizards there is a little creature, known as the guiko,
that frequents houses, and whose noise is very annoying. It is not a
fair representative of the &ldquo;cricket on the hearth.&rdquo; It has
its <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=

vermin. It clings with remarkable tenacity, even when dying, to the
piece of timber on which it is placed, the soles of its feet seeming to
be provided with suckers.</p>
<p>There are few scenes in nature more beautiful than a bush or tree
when lighted with the brilliant fireflies that illuminate the forests
at night. They seem almost to have a system of fire-telegraphy,
answering, as they do, each other by a sudden glow of a delicate green
hue, which gleams in quick succession from point to point of the
bush.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Locust Scourge.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The great scourge of the Philippines is the locust. It
will not touch the hemp plantations, but menaces and devastates almost
everything else green or growing. In 1851 the Government imported some
martins from China, for the extermination of the pest. They were
received by a procession of soldiers, with a band of music, and the
cages containing them were carried in state to Santa Mesa, where the
birds were turned loose. The severest penalties were then prescribed
for any person that should kill a martin. According to latest accounts,
however, the locusts still flourish.</p>
<p>The injury done by these pests to cultivated lands is always
serious, often disastrous. Miles of ripened crops may be devoured in a
single night. When the locust-army makes its descent by day, preparing
to attack a planted field, the natives do their best to drive it away
by dint of noise and glare, beating tin cans, rattling bamboo-choppers,
waving scarlet flags. Others make a dense smoke, by setting fire to
damp straw and other fuel. The insects are very sensitive to noise, and
the firing of small mortars, which the natives use at feasts, is a very
useful locust-dispeller.</p>
<p>In general appearance the locust looks like a large grasshopper; of
a light reddish-brown hue in the males, and a darker brown in the
females. The eggs are laid in the ground, which is pierced to the depth
of an inch by the auger-like ovipositor of the female. She continues
this process of egg-laying every few days, if allowed to
settle<span class="corr" id="xd21e4662" title="Source: ,">.</span>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>Two or three weeks are necessary for the
hatching. The grubs cannot be driven to flight, as their wings do not
sprout for about ten days, and they set themselves diligently to work
to eat their fill, making havoc in the growing crops. Though they
cannot fly, they can jump, and the plan adopted to dispose of them is
to form a barrier of sheet-iron at one side of the field, dig a pit
before it, and set a number of men to beat up the small game around the
other three sides of the field. In this way the young locusts may be
driven in heaps into the pit, and there destroyed. I have seen
instances where tons of these destructive pests were thus slain.</p>
<p>Locusts have been known to travel as far as sixty miles out to sea.
It is a curious fact, that, they avoid for several years a province
where large quantities of their number have been swallowed up and
destroyed by an earthquake.</p>
<p>Aside from their destroying growing-crops, these insects are
perfectly harmless; little children play with them, and older people
eat them, fried locust being esteemed a great delicacy by the
poor-class natives. I can vouch for one instance in which the
inhabitants of a certain village offered to pay the parish priest if he
would say mass for the continuance of this luxury. The scourge is thus
a terror to the planter, but a boon to his poor laborers.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To repeat: Among the chief nuisances in the
Philippines are mosquitoes and ants. The ordinary bed is a hemp mat,
without sheets, but never without ample mosquito nets, in the absence
of which sleep would be banished. The white ants are indeed formidable;
not like the locusts, feeding on green things growing, but destroying
dry wood and vegetable fibre, wherever found. They can literally devour
a house; and I have been gravely told that even the surface of iron is
not safe from their ravages.</p>

<p>Many anecdotes are extant concerning the silent, hidden, and rapid
ravages of these aggressive insects, working entirely out of sight, yet
finding their way by a sure instinct to anything that will serve them
for food. In one aggravating instance, happening in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>1838, the priests of a certain town had packed
away, in a trunk of narra-wood, the various articles used in the
service of the mass, including the robes, priests&rsquo; garments, and
so forth. The following day, March 19th, they were taken out and used,
and in the evening restored to the trunk. On the 20th some dirt was
seen near this receptacle, and it was opened. To the horror of all the
priests, their sacred vestments had vanished; nothing was left of them
but a layer of dust and the gold and silver lace, this being tarnished
by a filthy deposit. Yet not an ant was to be found in the trunk, nor
in any part of the church; and five days elapsed before it was
discovered how they had reached their prey. It was then found that they
had eaten through a beam six inches thick, making a small hole, through
which they obtained access to the trunk.</p>

<p>Blind though they are, their other senses seem to be remarkably
developed. They work from underground, never appearing at the surface,
and will excavate a piece of furniture until it is a mere shell, and
falls at a touch, yet not show the least vestige of a tunnel
outside.</p>
<p>One ignorant servant-girl had lent her earnings, in hard silver
dollars, to a relative, and on asking to be repaid was gravely informed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=

ants had eaten it. This preposterous story was believed by the girl,

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Many and notable have been the struggles of the
Filipinos to escape the yoke of the Spanish tyrant. But in all cases
European intelligence and Spanish treachery proved too strong for the
simple natives, and thus, after every revolt, the chains of servitude
were riveted only more firmly.</p>
<p>As early as 1622 there was a revolt on Bojol island, which was
speedily quelled. The same year saw a great insurrection in Leyte,
which was put down only after great difficulty. The leaders were all
executed: some were garroted, others shot with arrows, and many burnt
at the stake.</p>

</div>
<p>Despite these extreme punishments, a rising took place in Surigao,
in the eastern part of Mindanao, in 1629, which lasted for three years.
At last, weary of the tyranny of the church, the natives rose <i>en
masse</i> and killed the priests. Expedition after expedition was sent
from Manila; and after much loss on the Spanish side, and a vigorous
resistance on the part of the rebels themselves, the rebellion was
brought to an end. But the peace that followed was destined to be of
short duration. In 1649 the Governor-General put into effect the odious
press-law, which caused a general protest and a formidable revolt. A
native, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>Sumoroy by name, killed a priest that had
grievously wronged him, and led the insurrection. The Spanish soldiers,
unable to apprehend him, discovered his mother, and literally tore her
to pieces. Sumoroy, goaded into a very frenzy of vengeance, pursued his
enemies with merciless hate, and many fell a victim to his cruelty. He
was finally betrayed by his own people and beheaded. His head was stuck
on a pole and paraded through the province. Other chiefs then
surrendered, on the condition of receiving a full pardon; but the
Spaniards forgot their fair promises, and promptly hanged them as soon
as they had them in hand. This rebellion also extended to other
provinces, but was quelled by the proclamation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span>of a
general amnesty. All those that took part in it, however, were,
finally, executed or imprisoned.</p>
<p>In 1660 there was another rising in Pampanga, where the natives were
forced to cut down timber without payment. In Pangasinan province
Andres Malong, a native, was declared King. He advanced toward the
capital with a large army, gathering reinforcements on the way, till he
had with him about 40,000 men. These were met by a small but well-armed
Spanish force, and were routed. Most of the chiefs were captured and
hanged.</p>
<p>In 1744 a Jesuit parish priest, Morales, by his despotic manner and
arrogance, embittered the natives of his flock. One of these, whose
brother&rsquo;s body was left uninterred because his family could not
furnish enough money to satisfy the unjust demands of the avaricious
priest, led a party of natives against him. Morales was captured and
executed, and his own body left in the sun. Dagohoy then raised the
standard of revolt, and was joined by many thousands of his countrymen.
He and his people thus maintained their independence for thirty-five
years, when they finally submitted and were pardoned. On account of the
strength and the multitude of the offenders in this insurrection the
Spaniards were afraid to visit upon them the customary punishment; they
feared to provoke another rebellion.</p>
<p>In 1823 a creole, Andres Novales, conspired to seize the capital and
to control the Government. He and his fellow-conspirators, however,
were seized and executed.</p>
<p>In 1827 there was a small rebellion in Ceb&uacute;, which was
quelled by the friars. Another insurrection took place in Negros in
1844, when the Governor of the province was killed, because he made the
natives work for his own private purpose.</p>

<p class="first">In 1872 the friars were again the cause of a great
revolt. Dr Joseph Burgos, a prominent native, led a party that urged
the exclusion of the friars from parochial incumbencies. This had been
promised at the council of Trent. The night of a suburban feast
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>was the time agreed upon by the natives for the
attack. The native soldiers of the garrison were also in the plot; and
thus the arsenal was taken almost without a struggle, while the
Europeans were now made the object of the attack. The latter rallied,
however, and drove out the invaders. The arsenal was re-taken and many
rebels were killed and taken prisoners. Burgos himself, with three
other native priests, was apprehended and executed on the old sea-wall
by the Luneta, that spot so richly sanctified by the blood of
patriot-heroes.</p>

<p>Many others of the native clergy were banished. And ever since this
revolt the native priests have been under suspicion, and native youths
are no longer allowed to study for the priesthood. In this instance the
insurgents had planned a revolutionary government, which, if
successfully carried out, would have reflected great honor upon the
leaders.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Present Rebellion.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In August, 1896, the present rebellion was begun. The
causes of this uprising were similar to those that caused the preceding
insurrections; the arrogance and the exactions of the friars, the
oppressive taxes, the licenses and numerous fees, and other extortions
practised by the Government officials were again the source of much
discontent among the people. The natives, furthermore, were compelled
to submit to usurious loans whenever they wished to raise money to
carry on the various kinds of domestic enterprise. If a native was
unable to satisfy the claims against him, his property was immediately
confiscated by the Government. This power of confiscation was used most
effectively against the well-to-do-natives, who thus were fleeced by
the officials on the slightest pretext.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Katipunan.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Smarting under these grievances, the natives formed a
secret Revolutionary League, called the Katipunan, which soon numbered
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span>not less than 50,000 men. Cavit&eacute; was the
rebel stronghold, and from the day of its inception till the present
time the rebellion has steadily grown; the barbarity and inhumanity of
the Spaniards, now proverbial, have caused similar retaliations on the
part of the rebels. And while this is not surprising, it is,
nevertheless, surely to be deplored.</p>
<p>If the civilized and religious Spaniard tortured his
prisoners,&mdash;by burning, smothering, disemboweling, and otherwise
mutilating,&mdash;what was to be expected of the half-civilized
ignorant native. He, however, displayed far more mercy and greater
magnanimity than his European enemy. The Spaniards, indeed, revived all
the horrors of the inquisition,&mdash;the thumbscrew, the stake, and
the rack. Is it a wonder that the Filipinos, rankling with the memory
of a recent outrage and an ancient wrong, sometimes inflicted the same
punishments on the unfortunate Spaniards that fell into their
hands?</p>

<p>For the rebels well knew that a policy of extermination had been
declared against them. Was it not at a banquet in Manila that the
Spanish officers made a compact to kill the savages like wild beasts in
their lairs, and to show quarter to none! We yet shudder when we think
of the black hole of Manila, in which one hundred prisoners were thrust
one night, of whom sixty were found dead the next morning&mdash;because
the one door that admitted air into the dungeon had been shut. We
remember with horror, too, the executions of the rebels in Manila.</p>
<p>The day of an execution was made a day of jubilee, when the
&eacute;lite of the city came out to grace the general rejoicing. It
was eagerly looked forward to, and, in honor of the great event, all
the prominent houses were decked in flags and bunting&mdash;the whole
city, in fact, assumed a holiday aspect.</p>
<p>The execution usually took place in the cool of the morning, when
the Luneta would be thronged with thousands of people, who came to
witness this grand vindication of the honor of Spain. Nor was the fair
sex lacking in these demonstrations of loyalty. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name="pb290">290</a>]</span>Here
come the victims, stolid and indifferent; behind them march the
soldiers, with measured tread.</p>
<p>The condemned are then made to stand upon the old sea-wall, and,
facing the sea, await their doom. The suspense becomes intense; a hush
falls over the expectant multitude, and a succession of sharp commands
falls upon the morning air. An answering click and a scattered volley
of shots, and the grim figures standing mutely on the sea-wall fall
headlong to the ground, many stark and stiff, others writhing in agony.
Hardly have the echoes of the shots died away, when a jubilant cheer
bursts from the assembled multitude. Men toss their hats into the air;
and ladies, beautiful and fashionably dressed, are waving their
handkerchiefs and clapping their hands in an ecstasy of enthusiasm. The
band bursts into triumphal music, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">And yet, notwithstanding this severe provocation, the
rebels rarely attacked non-combatants, and seldom injured private
property&mdash;an example of their self-restraint and their remarkable
forbearance. This, too, is seen in their refraining from molesting the
only railroad in the colony, whose traffic was, of course, an advantage
to the Spaniards. This railroad is owned by an English company, and
this fact alone saved it from destruction.</p>
<p>It is also said that when the insurgents had made their plans to
attack Manila, a list of all the foreigners and non-combatants was
carefully prepared by their leaders. This, as may be supposed, was done
so that these might be guarded from the pillage and slaughter that was
sure to follow a successful assault of the thousands of infuriated
natives, thirsting for the blood of their Spanish oppressors. It would
also be no exaggeration to say, that the great majority of all the
foreigners in the islands&mdash;Germans, English, Dutch, and
Americans&mdash;were secretly in sympathy with the cause of the
insurgents. And this is no cause for wonder, when one thinks of the
many and various impositions that the Spanish Government and its
unscrupulous officials have at every shadow of an opportunity practised
upon them. The rebellion began in the province of Cavit&eacute;, and
was made formidable by the thousands of refugees driven away from their
rude bamboo huts and tiny rice-fields by the Spaniards, come to pacify
the province.</p>

Peninsula, was sent against them, they were forced to retire; and,
accordingly, they entrenched themselves in the mountains near the
capital. Here they built a considerable fortress, and though the
greater <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=

kind, they were, nevertheless, made subject to the most rigid
discipline. Many of them, indeed, were engaged in the attempt to make
their own fire-arms, and it can readily be surmised how crude and
indifferent such weapons were. Those that could not secure guns,
however, armed themselves with some other weapon; and thus in the rebel
army were to be seen all sorts and styles of instruments for offensive
warfare, from the deadly native bolo to the large steel mowing scythe
of European make. Only 1200 of the 7000 men that composed this camp
possessed rifles; yet, even thus poorly equipped, for more than
eighteen months they kept up a desultory but harassing war against
15,000 well-armed Spanish troops.</p>

concessions, having been unable to do so by force. The rebel leaders
were accordingly approached, and these, relying upon the fair promises
of the Spaniards, made a treaty known as the Pact of <span class="corr"
id="xd21e4815" title="Source: Biaonabato">Biacnabato</span>, so named
after the village where it was signed, December 14th, 1897. In this
pact the following reforms are promised:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The banishment, or at least, the disbanding, of the
religious orders; Philippine representation in the Cortes; the same
administration of justice for the natives as for the Spaniards; unity
of laws between the Philippines and Spain; the natives to share the
chief offices of the Philippine civil administration; rearrangement of
the property of the friars and of the taxes in favor of the natives;
recognition of the individual rights of the natives, with liberty of
public meeting and of the press, and a general amnesty.</p>
</div>
<p>In return for these concessions, Aguinaldo and the other leaders
promised that if Rivera fulfilled these promised reforms, they would
leave the country for three years; and that they would stir up no
insurrection against the Spanish Government during this period. The
rebels then laid down their arms and surrendered their forts and
ammunition, and, according to other provisions of the treaty, Aguinaldo
received 400,000 pesetas, which were deposited in the Hong-Kong and
Shanghai Bank at Hong-Kong; not for his own personal use, but as a
fund, the interest of which, if <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294"
href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>the Spaniards carried out
their part of the agreement, was to be devoted to the education of
native youth in England.</p>
<p>In case the agreement was not carried out by the Spaniards, the
money was to be used for arms and to renew the rebellion.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">And how did the Spaniards fulfil their part of the
pact? Rivera at no time proclaimed a general amnesty; he denied the
existence of the pact, and shot several leaders, who, relying on his
promises, had returned to Manila. The rebellion was therefore
renewed.</p>
<p>Only lately, Aguinaldo has again been approached by the Spanish
leaders, who promised to carry out the reforms stated in the pact if he
would combine with them against the Americans. The Captain-General,
indeed, went so far as to create a Legislative Council, to which he
appointed some of the leading men in the Tagal Republic. Aguinaldo
treated his overtures with scorn; for he well knew that these fair
promises would, like those made before, be broken at the first
opportunity.</p>
<p>The most powerful political organization in the islands is the
Katipunan Society, already referred to, which has a membership of
50,000. Each member of this body made a weekly contribution to the
revolutionary fund. Among the Katipunans are a great many Freemasons,
who are most bitter in their opposition to the friars. And not without
reason; for at one time more than 3,000 Masons were imprisoned by the
friars, and fettered with irons.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The rebels were greatly encouraged by the presence in
their ranks of many women, who not only incited them to battle, but
often also took part themselves. Among these was Josephine Rizal, the
wife of the unfortunate and lamented Dr. Rizal,&mdash;one of the
leaders in this revolt.</p>
<p>Rizal was a native of high scientific acquirements, and had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name=
"pb295">295</a>]</span>considerable fame as a physician. He was also
the president of the Manila University, and was deemed a leader in
social and educational circles. But above all he was a patriot, and
desired beyond all else the freedom of his country. He soon became the
most ardent, as well as the most prominent, among the revolutionists,
who looked upon him with awe. However, he was suspected, and he was
exiled to Perin, on the island of Dapitan. There he performed a most
difficult and successful operation on a patient,&mdash;an
Irishman,&mdash;whose daughter fell violently in love with him. Rizal
was similarly affected, and the lovers were soon engaged.</p>

<p>Not long after, Rizal was taken back to Manila for trial. He was
condemned to death. On the morning of his execution<span class="corr"
id="xd21e4853" title="Not in source">,</span> December 6th, 1896, his
fianc&eacute;e came to visit him. It was an affecting
meeting&mdash;that last hour they were together. A sadder
trysting-place surely could not be imagined than that damp cell, over
which the glimmering light of dawn cast a sepulchral gloom.</p>
<p>And there, in that dreadful hour, on the brink of the grave, the
unhappy pair were united. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href=

<p>They remained together, kneeling, till the executioners came to lead
the bridegroom away.</p>
<p>Rizal&rsquo;s speech, at the place of execution, was powerful,
dignified, eloquent. He spoke without a tremor, and said that he
forgave his enemies, even as he himself hoped for forgiveness. He then
predicted that the Spanish power would fall within the next ten years.
He also asserted pride in his martyrdom, and said he was only sorry he
did not have another life to offer for his country.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was in December, 1897, that hostilities in the
Philippines, between the Spaniards and the rebels, ceased. Just before
the recent Hispano-American war began, Aguinaldo was in Singapore,
where, it is said, he entered into secret political relations with
Admiral Dewey, who was then at Hong-Kong. The Spaniards having broken
the conditions of the pact, Aguinaldo, of course, was at perfect
liberty to renew his attempts against his old enemy.</p>
<p>As a result of these negotiations with the Admiral, the rebel leader
offered to co-operate with the Americans in their occupation of Manila,
by assailing the capital with his forces on land; he also <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name=
"pb299">299</a>]</span>guaranteed to maintain order and discipline
among the native troops, to conduct the war in a humane manner, and to
prevent the natives from committing outrages on defenseless
non-combatants. He also declared his ability to establish a responsible
government on liberal principles.</p>

<h3 class="main">Aguinaldo as Dictator: His Proclamations.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Upon his return to the Philippines, May 24th,
Aguinaldo issued three proclamations. The first explained that he had
returned as dictator because the Spaniards had not carried out their
promised reforms. He had previously surrendered, he said, his arms and
disbanded his army, believing that the Spaniards were sincere in their
protestations and promises of reform, being led to such belief not by
any consistency in the past, but by the several guarantees <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>they
had given as pledges of their good faith. The reforms, however, ended
where they began, on paper, and the Government seemed helpless in the
hands of the friars, who, fearful of the light of truth and knowledge,
placed every obstacle in the way of progress. As the great and powerful
Republic, the United States, had offered protection, and were desirous
that the natives might gain their longed-for liberty and their
country&rsquo;s independence, he had come back to resume his command of
the army, and he now purposed to establish a dictatorship, with an
Advisory Council, until the islands were completely pacified and won. A
republican constitution could then be established and a legislature
elected. To this he would hand over the command of the army.</p>

<p class="figureHead">The President of the United States and His War
Cabinet.</p>
</div>
<p>In a second proclamation, Aguinaldo forbade all attempts at
negotiations for peace, between the rebels and the Spaniards since all
previous negotiations had proved but a deceptive lure to lead the
insurgents to their destruction. All Spaniards, therefore, coming to
parley without a flag of truce and the customary credentials, would be
shot as spies. On the other hand, any native that undertook such a
mission would be regarded as a traitor, and hanged, with a placard
attached to his body, inscribed with the words: &ldquo;Traitor to his
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The third proclamation shows the rebel leader&rsquo;s humane
intentions, and is remarkable when we reflect that it was written by
one of &ldquo;the cruel and bloodthirsty savages&rdquo; that the
Spanish soldiery had sworn to exterminate. I give this entire:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The great North American nation, a lover of true
liberty, and therefore desirous of liberating our country from the
tyranny and despotism to which it has been subjected by its rulers, has
shown us decided disinterested protection, considering us sufficiently
able and civilized to govern this unhappy shore.</p>
<p>In order to retain this high opinion of the never too-highly-praised
and great nation of North America, we should abominate such acts as
pillage and robbery of every description and acts of violence against
persons and property.</p>
<p>To avoid international complications during the campaign, I
order:&mdash;</p>
<p>First, lives and property of all foreigners are to be respected,
including Chinese <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302"
name="pb302">302</a>]</span>and those Spaniards who neither directly
nor indirectly have taken up arms against us.</p>
<p>Secondly, the lives and property of our enemies who lay down their
arms are to be equally respected.</p>
<p>Thirdly, in the same way, all hospitals and all ambulances, together
with the persons and effects therein, as well as their staffs, are to
be respected unless they show themselves hostile.</p>
<p>Fourthly, those who disobey what is set forth in the three former
articles, will be tried by summary court-martial and shot, if by such
disobedience there has been caused assassination, fires, robbery or
violence.</p>

<h3 class="main">Triumphant Progress of the Rebels.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Dewey&rsquo;s victory wonderfully increased the morale
of the rebel army; while the Spaniards daily lost hope. In two weeks
after landing, Aguinaldo had assembled a force of 3000 men with arms,
and fought many skirmishes. He had also captured two strong batteries,
and taken the whole province of Cavit&eacute;. He had made sixteen
hundred Spanish prisoners, and supplied his men with over 4000 rifles
and with several field-guns captured from the enemy.</p>
<p>On May 30th the Spaniards attacked the rebels, intrenched in a
strong position at Zapote. The engagement was a very severe one and
lasted ten hours, the Spaniards being forced to retire with a loss of
500 killed and wounded.</p>
<p>The rebels, now numbering about 5000, full of enthusiasm, and
well-armed, then attacked the Fourth, Sixth, and Eleventh Cazadores,
and several companies of the Sixty-eighth and Seventy-fourth regiments.
The natives in the last regiment deserted, after first killing their
own officers. The Spaniards were beaten back with severe losses, and
the rebels, with important reinforcements, then routed the enemy,
taking many prisoners. Not long after, the capital of the province of
Batangas was taken by the insurgents, and the Governor attempted to
commit suicide. The Governor of the province of Malabra was also taken
prisoner, and town after town, province after province, yielded to the
victorious rebels, who daily grew stronger and gradually closed in on
the capital. Outside, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href=
"#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span>in the bay, was anchored
Dewey&rsquo;s victorious American squadron, calmly awaiting
reinforcements from home. With these he would aid Aguinaldo to
prosecute the war on land.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Meanwhile, the Spaniards displayed great energy in
improving the defences of Manila. The moat was deepened, and all the
shrubbery wherein an enemy might lurk and find cover was destroyed.
For, as a last resource, the Spaniards intended to shut themselves in
their grim old fortress, as if they thought to find security there,
although a few ten-inch shells from the fleet would lay the whole city
in ruins. Everywhere facing the bay trenches were dug, and modern 9
pounder Krupp field-pieces were mounted, and mountain batteries brought
from the interior.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding these elaborate preparations, the Spaniards
were lacking in good modern ordnance and in accurate <span class="corr"
id="xd21e5117" title="Source: markmanship">marksmanship</span>.</p>
<p>Another great source of Spanish weakness was their native allies.
However, these professed great loyalty to the Spaniards, asserting that
they wished to fight to preserve the Catholic religion. These natives
had responded to a proclamation of the Captain-General, in which he
called them brothers, and appealed to them to help defend their faith
from the Yankee pigs who would desecrate &ldquo;the holy Catholic
church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few days after this proclamation, Spanish faith in these
professions of loyalty was rudely shaken; for some priests were
barbarously murdered by the natives. The following day, several
companies of these sworn allies, armed with Mauser rifles, attacked
Bacora, a small town between Cavit&eacute; and Manila, and, after a few
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span>hours, captured the place and drove the garrison
back to the capital. In this engagement several hundred Spaniards were
killed. The natives of a regiment distinguished for its loyalty,
massacred their officers and joined the insurgents. It is said that the
latter lost more than 2000 men; but thousands were ready to take their
places, eager for an opportunity to join against the common
oppressor.</p>
<p>It was to quell a threatened mutiny of these troops in Manila, that
the friars handed over $1,000,000 of their immense hoard to the
Captain-General, that he might satisfy long-standing arrears of pay. At
the same time, the insurgents received some field-guns, 5000 magazine
rifles, and 200,000 rounds of ammunition from Admiral Dewey; and
Aguinaldo and his forces continued their victorious advance step by
step, the Spaniards daily growing more discouraged.</p>
<p>In the latter part of June a body of United States troops landed and
took possession of Cavit&eacute;; and in July Aguinaldo proclaimed
himself President of the Revolutionary Republic.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">General Emilio Aguinaldo y Famy is a little more than
thirty years of age. He was born in Imus, a village near Cavit&eacute;.
His father was a planter, and the son was sent first to the College of
St. Jean de Lateran, then to the University of St. Tomas in Manila. The
youth&rsquo;s education cost his father much privation, for the cost of
pursuing a course of study at these institutions is not less than 1200
francs a year, and the elder Aguinaldo had great difficulty to make
both ends meet.</p>
<p>At St. Jean de Lateran the student is drilled in Spanish and Latin
and the classics; and when he is able to translate the masterpieces of
Rome with facility, he is ready for the University of St. Tomas. This,
like the College, is under the Dominicans. In the University, the
principal studies are physics, metaphysics, theology, jurisprudence,
law, and medicine.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo was adjudged a very dull student, and gave no promise of
distinction. In fact, the Dominicans finally sent him <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name="pb305">305</a>]</span>home
in sheer despair. Aguinaldo then entered the Normal school of the
Jesuits. Here he made some progress; but at this time his father died,
when the youth was forced to return home to take care of his patrimony,
which was threatened by the lawsuits instituted by the order of the
Recollectos&mdash;an organization composed of the greatest
land-proprietors of the colony. It was in 1893 that Dr. Rizal created
the Philippine League, the object of which was to unite politically the
various parts of the Archipelago.</p>
<p>Rizal was banished, but shortly afterward the order of the Katipunan
was formed, which soon had more than 250,000 members. The object of
this society was co-operation for the protection of the colonists.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Emilo Aguinaldo.</p>
</div>
<p>The Government then fearing an alliance of this society with the
Freemasons and the various secret orders hostile to Spanish rule, began
to take active measures against it. Aguinaldo was suspected
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>of being one of the leaders. A Spanish officer,
with a squad of native soldiers, came to arrest him. Aguinaldo, when
confronted by the officer, promptly shot him, then eloquently appealed
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name=
"pb307">307</a>]</span>his companions to leave the service of their
foreign oppressors and strike a blow for liberty.</p>

</div>
<p>The soldiers received his words with acclaim, and instantly chose
him as their leader. He then sought the fastnesses of the forest, where
he was soon joined by thousands of his countrymen&mdash;all flaming to
join the standard of revolt.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo is short of stature, with a well-knit figure. He has the
Japanese cast of face, and wears a black pompadour, which heightens
that impression. His countenance is imperturbable; it is notable for
its serious expression. During the rebellion he was in hourly fear of
assassination. For, a reward of $25,000 had been offered by the
Spaniards for his head; and this prize had brought into his camp a host
of mercenaries, that were only seeking a convenient opportunity to gain
the coveted reward.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo&rsquo;s headquarters were in the former home of a rich
native in Cavit&eacute;. With him were his staff and his mother and
several of his relatives. These he kept with him to secure them from
Spanish vengeance.</p>
<p>The house is described as broad, low, and roomy. In front is a paved
court; on each side a trusted number of stalwart insurgents constantly
kept guard. The uniform of these soldiers was a cheap native homespun;
their arms were of the crudest description; but they made up in loyalty
what they lacked in training.</p>
<p>The General himself usually wore a spotless suit of white linen, a
white shirt, with a well-polished front, a high collar and a black
necktie. He wore red velvet slippers, embroidered in gold. In his
office was a modern desk,&mdash;piled high with documents,&mdash;a
large mirror, two large, strong, iron boxes,&mdash;which served as a
safe for the moneys of the insurgent government,&mdash;and a grand
piano of Spanish make. Against a hat-rack leaned the rebel standard,
and on the wall hung a map of the province. This the General used to
scan eagerly, tracing the movements and the disposition of his
troops.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo was usually surrounded by various members of his staff,
none of whom, however, was as impressive as himself. I <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name=
"pb308">308</a>]</span>believe Aguinaldo to be sincere and patriotic.
He is courageous, and has surely proved himself an able general.</p>
<p>He has unbounded influence with his countrymen, and while, as
stated, $25,000 was offered for his head, no one betrayed him or
attempted to make an assault upon his life.</p>

alt="Types of the Tagban&uacute;a Tribe." width="700" height="504">
<p class="figureHead">Types of the Tagban&uacute;a Tribe.</p>
</div>
<p>He is bravery personified, and inasmuch as the Filipinos admire this
above all other attributes, Aguinaldo is always at the head. He is a
born leader, and has just enough tact to adopt expediencies and make
compromises, yet not seem to do so.</p>
<p>And in so doing he, nevertheless, rarely appears to infringe upon
his own original plans.</p>
<p>In everything he takes the initiative; in no event does he consult
any one. He brooks no opposition; he has had no rivals in reality:
there have been one or two would-be-ones, but they could not withstand
him. He is perhaps not always scrupulous as to the attainment of his
ends, yet his proclamations are wise and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb309" href="#pb309" name="pb309">309</a>]</span>moderate, his conduct
all one would desire in even a European dictator. Moreover, few have
shown themselves so modest and so merciful.</p>
<p>There is a tremendous magnetism about the man, and whenever he
addresses his troops, he holds them with a grip that would be
spellbound but for the rapt attention and for the devotion that is
vociferously manifested.</p>
<p>The natives, too, seem to be unable, as well as unwilling, to get
away from his power; and, to all appearances, he is to the islanders
the man of the hour.</p>
<p>Of course I do not agree with him in everything he does, but,
knowing his sincerity, and believing that he makes his spectacular
display merely to impress the natives, and so hold their allegiance, I
therefore admire him and hope that the Americans will co-operate with
him to give us a stable Philippine Government.</p>
<p>At all events, the man&rsquo;s strong personality, and his large
following, cannot, I believe, well be ignored by the American
Government.</p>

<h3 class="main">The White Squadron.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was the 19th of April. An American fleet lay in the
harbor of Hong-Kong, where it had been anchored for nearly a month,
impatiently awaiting the command that should send it to battle.</p>
<p>There was feverish expectation of war, and bustle of preparation,
and Commodore Dewey nervously walked the deck; for, every moment the
longed-for order was expected.</p>
<p>It was the 19th of April, and the White Squadron lay gleaming in the
sunlight,&mdash;and yet by the night of the 20th the White Squadron was
no more; for she had exchanged the snowy garb of peace for the sombre
gray of war. The ships&rsquo; painters had, in this short time, given
the entire fleet a significant coating of drab.</p>
<p>The English steamer Nanshan, with over three thousand tons of
Cardiff coal, and the Steamer Zafiro, of the Manila-Hong-Kong line,
carrying 7,000 tons of coal and provisions, had just been bought by the
Commodore, in anticipation of a declaration of neutrality, which would
preclude such purchases, and thus two more vessels were added to the
fleet, Lieutenant Hutchins being made commander of the Nanshan, and
Ensign Pierson of the Zafiro. The Zafiro was then made a magazine for
the spare ammunition of the fleet. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311"
href="#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span></p>
<p>Hong-Kong, for strategic reasons, had been chosen as a place of
rendezvous for the Asiatic Squadron.</p>

<h3 class="main">Declaration of War, and Journey to the
Philippines.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On April 25th war was declared between the United
States and Spain, and, at the request of the acting-Governor of
Hong-Kong, the American fleet steamed away to Mirs Bay, about thirty
miles from Hong-Kong. On April 26th the revenue cutter McCulloch, which
had been left at Hong-Kong, brought the desired message. It read as
follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first dateline"><i>Washington, April 26th.</i></p>
<p><i>Dewey, Asiatic Squadron: Commence operations at once,
particularly against the Spanish fleet. You must capture or destroy
them.</i></p>
<p class="signed"><i>McKinley</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God!<span class="corr" id="xd21e5242" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> said the Commodore. &ldquo;At last
we&rsquo;ve got what we want. We&rsquo;ll blow them off the Pacific
Ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now the fleet was headed direct for Manila, a distance of 628
miles; and, with hearts beating high with hope, the sailors cheered
lustily for Old Glory and the Navy Blue.</p>
<p>In the squadron were the following vessels: Olympia, flagship,
Captain C. V. Gridley, commanding; Boston, Captain Frank Wildes;
Concord, Commander Asa Walker, and the Petrel, Commander E. P. Wood.
The Raleigh, Captain J. B. Coughlan, commanding, and the Baltimore,
commanded by Captain N. M. Dyer, also joined the squadron.</p>
<p>All these vessels were cruisers. The single armored ship in the
squadron was the Olympia; and the armor&mdash;four inches
thick&mdash;was around the turret guns.</p>
<p>In making the journey to the Philippines a speed of only eight knots
was maintained; for the transport ships could not make fast headway
against the rolling sea.</p>
<p>During this run, gun-drills and other exercises kept the men
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>busy, and every minute was employed in earnest
preparation for what all knew was to come.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Luzon Sighted, and Preparations for Battle.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was on Saturday morning, April the 30th, that Luzon
was sighted, and final preparations for the battle were immediately
made. Impedimenta of all kinds were thrown overboard,&mdash;chairs,
tables, chests and boxes,&mdash;and the ships were stripped and made
ready for action. It was intensely warm, and the most ordinary
evolutions proved exhausting.</p>
<p>The Boston, the Concord, and the Baltimore were now sent ahead to
discover whether the Spanish fleet was anywhere around.</p>
<p>After looking in at Bolinao Bay, these three vessels cautiously
approached Subig Bay, about 30 miles from Manila. However, only a few
small trading-vessels were here discovered, though it had been reported
that the enemy intended to give the Americans battle there.</p>
<p>When the scouting ships reported that the enemy was nowhere in
sight, the Commodore replied: &ldquo;All right, we shall meet them in
Manila Bay.&rdquo; A war-council was then held on the Olympia, and the
American commander told his officers that he intended to enter Manila
Bay that very night.</p>
<p>The squadron then slowly proceeded in the direction of Manila. It
was a sultry evening, and the yellow moon paved the waves with a
pathway of gold, that seemed like a glorious avenue to victory.</p>
<p>Fearing that they might come upon the enemy at any moment, the men
were posted at their guns, and, with the greatest quietness, the fleet
steamed stealthily forward. The lights on all the ships were put out,
save the one at the stern, and so the squadron slipped into the bay,
each moment dreading a challenge from the strongly-fortified batteries
that the Americans had been taught to believe were located at every
point along the entrance.</p>
<p>The speed was now increased to eight knots; for the Commodore wished
to be as far inside as possible before his presence was discovered.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name=
"pb313">313</a>]</span></p>
<p>Through the dangerous channels, mined with death-hurling torpedoes,
swept the silent squadron, grim and spectre-like. Well did the
Americans know the dangers of this undertaking; and few there were that
did not momentarily expect some exploding mine to hurl them into
eternity.</p>
<p>Then Corregidor Island, with its lofty lighthouse, came within view,
and the ships swept into the chief channel, known as the Boca
Grande.</p>

<p class="figureHead">A Battery at the Corner of the Old

</div>
<p>The Commodore, having so far failed to discover the presence of the
enemy, naturally concluded that the Spanish fleet was lying at
Cavit&eacute;, where it would have the advantage of the protection of
the forts and the shore-batteries.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Fleet Sails by Corregidor.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">And thus, with a full appreciation of the thousand and
one dangers, known and unknown, that beset his path, Dewey kept
straight by Corregidor. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href=
"#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span></p>
<p>It was eleven o&rsquo;clock, and the men of the fleet, which was now
almost past the island, were congratulating themselves that they were
undiscovered when a solitary rocket soared over the lofty lighthouse;
there was an answering light from the shore, and every moment the
Americans expected the boom of the Spanish guns, long primed with a
deadly welcome for the &ldquo;Yankee pigs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The narrowest part of the inlet had been passed, and still no sign
that the entering fleet had been discovered. Impressive, indeed, was
that long line of gloomy hulls, steering for battle, and courting
destruction. The Olympia, the Baltimore, the Raleigh, the Petrel, the
Concord, and the Boston, with the two transports the Nanshan and the
Zapiro, convoyed by the McCulloch, on the flag-ship&rsquo;s port
quarter&mdash;all kept on in the same straight course, while the men on
board were partaking of light refreshment. For all felt that a great
day&rsquo;s work was before them.</p>
<p>But where are the enemy? was the thought uppermost in every mind.
For to the Americans themselves it seemed that they were surely making
enough noise to be heard by the sentries on the shore. Doubtless they
were asleep, dreaming a Spanish dream of <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e5299" title="Source: manana">ma&ntilde;ana</span>.</p>
<p>It was shortly past eleven o&rsquo;clock, when from the smokestack
of the convoy McCulloch flew a shower of sparks. A fireman had thrown
open the furnace-doors and shoveled in a few pounds of soft coal.</p>
<p>This was evidently seen by some one on shore, for it was just
fourteen minutes past eleven when a bugle sounded an alarm, and from
the west came a blinding glare, a shrill whistle overhead, and the
heavy boom of a cannon.</p>

<h3 class="main">First Shot of the War.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was the first shot of the war, and it was fired
with characteristic Spanish inaccuracy.</p>
<p>Again the battery thundered; and then a third time, before there was
a reply from the American fleet. The Raleigh, which was the third
vessel in the line, was the first to speak for the American side, and
then the Boston followed, with stentorian roar, and the battle
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span>was on. Again the battery sent its deadly
missive over the fleet, and this time the Concord, taking its aim by
the flash, responded by throwing a six-inch shell into the Spanish
fort. A crash and a cry and all was still. It was learned afterward
that considerable damage was done by this wonderfully accurate shot,
several of the Spanish gunners being killed.</p>
<p>The Boston and the McCulloch fired another round or two; but the
forts had evidently had enough of it: they were no longer heard
from.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the squadron continued its course, though its speed was
reduced to about three knots an hour, the Commodore not wishing to
arrive at Manila before dawn.</p>

<p class="figureHead">The Spanish Fleet, as It Appeared in the

</div>
<p>A gray darkness hung over the harbor as the gray procession glided
noiselessly in. Had a Spanish scout been on the lookout, it would
scarcely have been possible for him to have distinguished his
approaching enemy. A strict lookout was kept for the Spanish ships and
for the dreaded torpedo boats, while most of the men lay down by their
guns to get a little sleep. But with the terrible fate of the Maine
vivid in their memories, the more imaginative ones conjured up a
shuddering sense of insecurity in a harbor supposed to be literally
planted with destructive mines. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316"

<h3 class="main">The Spanish Fleet is Sighted.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This invisible foe&mdash;and not the longed-for and
expected combat with the enemy&rsquo;s fleet&mdash;was feared by the
brave Americans, and when the morning sun, in all his tropical
splendor, rose right before the Americans, under the guns of
Cavit&eacute; lay the Spanish fleet. The Americans were at last face to
face with the enemy.</p>
<p>The commander-in-chief of the Spanish squadron was Rear-Admiral
Patricio Montojo y Pasaron; the second in command was the Commandante
General Enrique Sostoa y Ordennez.</p>
<p>Under Admiral Montojo&rsquo;s command were the following
vessels:</p>
<p>Reina Cristina, flagship, armored cruiser, Captain L. Cadarso
commanding, 3,500 tons; battery six 6.2-inch; two 2.7-inch; six
6-pounders; and six 3-pounder rapid-fire guns; speed, 17.5 knots; crew
400 officers and men.</p>
<p>Castilla, Captain A. M. de Oliva, commanding; 3,334 tons; battery,
four 5.9-inch; two 4.7-inch; two 3.3-inch; four 2.9-inch, and eight
6-pounder rapid-fire guns; speed, 14 knots; crew, 300.</p>
<p>Isla de Cuba, Captain J. Sidrach, and Isla de Luzon, Captain J. de
la Herian; 1,030 tons each; battery, four 4.7 inch; four 6-pounder and
two 3-pounder rapid-fire guns; speed, 14 knots; crew, 200 men each.</p>
<p>General Lezo, Commander R. Benevento, and Marques del Duero,
Commander S. Morena Guerra; the former was 524, the latter 500 tons;
batteries, two 4.7 inch; one 3.5 inch, and two 3-pounder rapid-fire
guns; speed, 11 knots; crew, 100.</p>
<p>Altogether the Americans had four cruisers, two gunboats, one
cutter, fifty-seven classified big guns, seventy-four rapid-firing guns
and machine guns, and 1808 men.</p>
<p>On the other side were seven cruisers, five gunboats, two torpedo
boats, fifty-two classified big guns, eighty-three rapid-firing and
machine guns, and 1,948 men.</p>
<p>It will thus be seen that the Americans had a few more heavy guns;
but the Spanish had several more ships and over a hundred more men.
They were also assisted by the powerful land-batteries, and by the
knowledge of the exact distance of the American ships. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>For
the latter had no range-marks with which to determine the proper
elevation to be given to their sights. In the American squadron,
moreover, was not a single armored cruiser; besides, the Spaniards were
at their base of supplies, while Commodore Dewey was more than six
thousand miles away from all aid.</p>
<p>Such were the numbers and the disposition of the combatants now
about to fight.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">With Old Glory flying at every masthead, and with the
beating of drums, the American squadron, after a brief reconnoitering
detour in the harbor, sailed in a straight line past the fleet of the
enemy. Each ship was to hold its fire until near enough to inflict the
most damage, when as many shots should be fired as possible. Then to
steam as quickly as possible out of effective range; to wheel and
return&mdash;keeping close to the opposite shore&mdash;to the original
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318</a>]</span>point of starting, when the same man&oelig;uvre
was to be repeated&mdash;and so again and again till the enemy was
destroyed or defeated.</p>
<p>On the Spanish fleet, too, all was bustle and preparation; the
national flag, that symbol of medi&aelig;val tyranny, floated from
every masthead, the Admiral&rsquo;s flag on the Reina Cristina being
the cynosure of all eyes.</p>
<div class="figure floatRight xd21e5370width" id="p318"><img src=

<p class="figureHead">The Reina Cristina; Flagship of Admiral
Montojo.</p>
</div>
<p>The Americans had left their supply-ships behind, and their fleet,
according to pre-arranged plan, steamed slowly past the enemy.
Meanwhile, the batteries of Cavit&eacute; kept up an incessant roar,
and now Montojo&rsquo;s flagship thundered a deadly welcome; while over
the American flagship was hoisted a code-flag, with the watchword
&ldquo;Remember the Maine!&rdquo; This was the signal for a concerted
yell from the sailors in the fleet. And thus with colors flying, and
with fire reserved till a closer range should make it more effective,
the Commodore and his brave officers bore down toward the Spaniards,
who were awaiting their approach with curiosity not unmixed with alarm,
at the same time they sent a thunderous <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e5376" title="Source: fusilade">fusillade</span> as a greeting to
the hated Yankees.</p>
<p>But the Americans, undeterred, grimly kept their course,
notwithstanding one or two mines exploded beneath the water,&mdash;one
near the Raleigh and one beside the Baltimore. Again and again the
Spanish guns thundered, until the roar became incessant and shells were
bursting all around.</p>
<p>When about six thousand yards the Commodore shouted to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span>Captain Gridley, who was in the conning tower:
&ldquo;Fire, as soon as you get ready, Gridley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly had he given the word&mdash;which also was passed down the
line&mdash;when the whole ship shivered, and the eight-inch gun in the
front turret burst into a sheet of flame, while a dull muffled roar
belched forth, that awoke the apparent torpor of the whole fleet to
instant activity.</p>
<p>The Baltimore and the Boston now took up the cue, and sent their
tremendous shells crashing into the enemy, who replied vociferously.
The din was deafening, and over and around all the American ships was
the shriek and scream of terrifying shells. Some of these fell upon the
decks, some smashed into the woodwork; but&mdash;as if
providentially&mdash;not an American was hit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open with all the guns,&rdquo; signaled the Commodore; and
all the ships joined together in a roaring chorus, as if Cerberus and
all the dogs of hell had opened their mighty throats.</p>
<p>And thus with incessant firing, the battle-line passed the whole
length of the stationary Spanish fleet, then slowly swang round and
began the return to its starting-point, keeping up the same flash and
clatter, the Spaniards responding furiously. It was at this time that a
shot passed clean through the Baltimore, though, fortunately, no one
was hurt. Lieutenant Brumbuys had the signal halyard shot out of his
hands; while on the Boston a shell burst in the state-room of Ensign
Dodridge, and another passed through the Boston&rsquo;s foremast.</p>
<p>During the third round the Raleigh was carried by the strong current
against the bows of two of the Spanish cruisers, where all aboard
seemed too bewildered to take advantage of their opportunity. Captain
Coughlan, however, did not lose his presence of mind, but poured a
destructive broadside into the enemy. His vessel was then carried back
into the line.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Fate of the Reina Cristina.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">While this fierce combat was waging, the Reina
Cristina moved out of the Spanish line and made direct for the American
flagship, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320" name=
"pb320">320</a>]</span>which hurled a perfect tornado of lead into the
approaching cruiser, her immense hulk being soon riddled with large
holes, where the eight-inch shells had entered. The port-bridge, where
Admiral Montojo was standing, was also struck; but he bravely stuck to
his post, while ton after ton of steel fell upon the deck.</p>
<p>No ship, however, could withstand such a fire, and the gallant Reina
Cristina turned round and made for the shore. As she swang round,
Captain Gridley gave her a parting shot, that caused her to tremble and
stagger, while the 250-pound shell crashed through the bowels of the
ship and there exploded, hurling its deadly contents all round, while
from the shattered deck rose columns of steam, mingled with human
fragments. The ship, now completely disabled, continued her retreat.
Sixty of her crew had been killed, and had she continued longer within
the Americans&rsquo; range, all would have met a like fate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the little Petrel was engaged in a duel with two Spanish
torpedo boats, headed for the American line. One of these she chased to
the shore, where the crew sought shelter in the woods, while their
abandoned vessel was blown into pieces by the daring American. The
other advanced to within 500 yards of the Olympia, braving the storm of
shot and shell that threatened to overwhelm her. As it was, a shell
ploughed its way into her middle, where it exploded. From stern to beam
she shivered, gave a forward plunge, and sank beneath the waves.</p>
<p>The Baltimore, too, was engaged in an encounter with the Castilla,
that resulted most disastrously to the latter; for she was soon a
blazing wreck.</p>
<p>Five times the American fleet passed in front of the enemy, keeping
up the same deadly fire, that showed only too well the results of
American training and marksmanship. And though the Spanish guns in the
ships and the forts ceased rattling not one instant, they neither
disconcerted nor damaged in the least the Americans. It was now a
quarter of eight, and so dense was the smoke hanging over the waters,
that it was impossible for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321"
href="#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>Americans to distinguish not
alone the enemy&rsquo;s ships, but their own vessels, and the signals,
too.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Commodore Pipes All Hands to Breakfast.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Commodore now wisely concluded to stop for awhile
the fighting, and allow his men a chance to take some breakfast; for
the brave fellows, after their morning&rsquo;s hard work, were hungry
as wolves; so the signal &ldquo;cease firing&rdquo; was given, and the
ships were headed for the eastern side of the bay, near the transport
ships.</p>
<p>It is related that the Spaniards were exceedingly relieved when they
saw the Americans in&mdash;as they thought&mdash;full retreat, and many
of them stood on the decks and cheered, thinking they had gained the
victory.</p>
<p>When the various commanders came on board to report to Commodore
Dewey, it was found that not a ship was disabled, not a gun out of
order, not a man killed or injured. It is true, Frank B. Randall, the
engineer of the McCulloch, died from heart-disease as the fleet steamed
past Corregidor, but this was not in any wise due to the engagement.
Many miraculous escapes, indeed, are related; and it is really
wonderful that no serious casualties took place. The sailors, as may
easily be imagined, were nearly wild with joy; and as all hands were
piped to breakfast, the decks were gay with merry jackies improvising a
dance of victory; while the strains of Yankee Doodle and the
Star-Spangled Banner filled the morning air. Cheery was that breakfast,
and sweet, ah, sweet was the three hours&rsquo; rest so nobly
earned.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Americans Renew the Battle.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At 10.45 the boatswains&rsquo; whistles and the drums
announced the renewal of the battle. Instantly every man was at his
post, eager to finish the job so well begun. Again the American
squadron was headed to ward the enemy&rsquo;s battle line; but several
of the Spanish ships were now almost disabled, the Cristina and the
Castilla were both on fire, and the Mindanao beached not far from
Cavit&eacute;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span></p>
<p>Admiral Montojo had meanwhile transferred his flags to the Isla de
Cuba; and the Baltimore, leaving the American line, made straight for
his former flagship, which threw a torrent of shells toward the
intrepid American. The Baltimore, however, notwithstanding that a few
of these deadly missiles exploded on her deck, wounding eight of her
crew, continued her course till within 2500 yards of her antagonist.
Then from her decks she fired a broadside at the Spaniard. There was an
ominous silence for a minute or two, and both Spaniards and Americans
waited anxiously for the smoke to lift. Suddenly, all saw a sight that
struck every man in both fleets with terror, for it seemed the probable
fate of all. The Cristina shot into the air and then fell back upon the
waves with a thunderous crash, while a thousand fragments of men and
timbers&mdash;promiscuously mingled in awful confusion&mdash;were
whirling through the air. Down into the waves she sank&mdash;that
gallant man-of-war&mdash;the pride of the Spanish fleet&mdash;down into
the deep blue sea. Upon the surface, amid tons of floating
d&eacute;bris, a hundred sailors struggled for life; many sank to rise
no more; some, however, succeeded in reaching one of the adjacent
consorts.</p>

height="346">
<p class="figureHead">The Isla de Cuba: To It the Spanish Flag Was
Transferred.</p>
</div>
<p>The Baltimore, aided by the Olympia and the Raleigh, now kept up a
deadly fire on the Juan de Austria; which answered this terrible
fusillade with intermittent volleys, that spoke well for the courage,
but poorly for the aim, of her gunners.</p>
<p>It was at this moment that the Raleigh sent a shell crashing through
the other&rsquo;s centre, exploding her magazine; in an instant she
seemed a crater of flame, and sank back like the Cristina, a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name=
"pb323">323</a>]</span>total wreck. Her flying fragments also inflicted
such damage upon the gunboat El Correo, which lay beside her, that she
was completely disabled. The Petrel gave her a finishing shot, that
closed her brief career. Another Spanish gunboat, the General Lezo,
also set out to accomplish great things, but the Concord, with a few
good shots, put a quietus upon her warlike ambition, and, like her
sister ships, she too was soon a floating wreck.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Boston was engaged in a duel with the Velasco.
Captain Wildes, of the former, stood on the bridge of his ship
vigorously fanning with a palm-leaf fan; for it was a hot morning and
it was the captain&rsquo;s policy to keep cool. The Velasco responded
to the Boston&rsquo;s broadsides but feebly. Then with a plunge she
careened to one side and sank heavily, her crew having scarcely enough
time to escape to the adjacent shore. The Castilla had already been set
on fire and scuttled by her crew, to prevent her magazine from
exploding.</p>
<p>The Don Antonia de Ulloa, which was engaged with the Olympia and the
Boston, though riddled with shells and on fire in a dozen places,
refused to surrender. Her gallant commander Robion stuck to his ship to
the very last; then she sank with colors flying, a signal example of
Spanish bravery. Another vessel had hauled down her flag, but when a
boat&rsquo;s crew from the McCulloch approached to take possession of
her, she treacherously fired on them. Suddenly, from every ship in the
American fleet there thundered a swift and awful retribution. There was
darkness around her shivering hull, there was a dull explosion and a
lurid glare; and when the smoke had rolled away nothing but a few
floating fragments were left to indicate the traitor&rsquo;s fate.</p>
<p>Thus ship after ship of the Spanish fleet met a like fate, until
Admiral Montojo, on the deck of the deserted and almost-useless Isla de
Cuba, took down his colors, and, with a few surviving officers, escaped
to the shore.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But, notwithstanding the destruction and the surrender
of the Spanish fleet, the batteries kept up an incessant fire. The
Americans <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=

speedily silenced them. The Petrel was left behind to complete the
destruction of the smaller gunboats. This she did most effectually.</p>

<p class="figureHead">The Olympia: Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s Flagship.</p>
</div>
<p>As the Cavit&eacute; Arsenal unfurled the white flag, the command
&ldquo;Cease firing&rdquo; was given, and the various American
commanders once more gathered on the flagship, their men cheering
themselves hoarse.</p>
<p>A most extraordinary victory, truly! Not one man lost, and only six
men slightly wounded, all on the Baltimore; while the Baltimore,
Olympia, and Raleigh suffered injuries that could be repaired in a few
hours.</p>
<p>The Spanish, on the other hand, were almost annihilated, and lost
the following vessels: Sunk: Reina Cristina, Castilla, Don Antonia de
Ulloa. Burnt: Don Juan de Austria, Isla de Luzon, Isla de Cuba, General
Lezo, Marquis del Duero, El Correo, Velasco, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name="pb325">325</a>]</span>and
Isla de Mindanao. Captured: Manila, and several tugs and small
launches. Besides this, the enemy lost more than 600 men.</p>
<p>On the day following the engagement, the squadron returned to
Cavit&eacute;, where it took up a permanent position until the arrival
of the transports from America. On the third of May the Spanish
evacuated Cavit&eacute; Arsenal, which was then held by a detachment
from the fleet. The same day the batteries on Corregidor Island
surrendered to the Raleigh and the Baltimore. And thus ended the
greatest naval battle in American history.</p>

<h3 class="main">Merritt, and the Expedition.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Spanish fleet had been destroyed; Cavit&eacute;
had been taken; and Admiral Dewey lay in the harbor awaiting the
reinforcements that were on the way.</p>
<p>These reinforcements had been sent out in three expeditions: the
first expedition, Brigadier-General Anderson commanding, consisted of
115 officers and 2,386 enlisted men; the second, under
Brigadier-General Greene, of 158 officers and 3,428 enlisted soldiers;
the third, under command of General McArthur, consisted of 197
officers, and 4,650 men. With these expeditions went the Astor Battery
and Major-General Wesley Merritt, who had been chosen
Commander-in-chief of the United States forces in the Philippines. In
all, over 11,000 men were on their way to Manila, and a fourth
expedition, consisting of 1,763 men, under Brigadier-General H. G.
Otis, was soon to follow.</p>
<p>It was the cruiser Charleston, which conveyed the transports of one
of these expeditions, that stopped to have a little fun, by way of
profitable diversion, at the island of Guam, one of the Ladrones.</p>
<p>Thirteen shells from the Charleston went thundering against the
fortress of Santa Cruz. But even thirteen proved insufficient to
provoke a Spanish reply. However, a half-hour after the bombardment
began, the captain of the port, Lieutenant Commander Jos&eacute; Garcia
y Gutierrez, of the Spanish navy, accompanied by one <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327" name="pb327">327</a>]</span>or
two other Spanish officers, were rowed to the Charleston, and, having
been taken on board, apologized for their seeming discourtesy; they
said that lack of ammunition at the fortress made it impossible for
them to return the American salute. They were, in fact, unaware that
war had been declared between the United States and Spain, and were,
therefore, much surprised when Captain Henry Glass informed them that
they were prisoners of war. They were sent ashore and ordered to convey
to the Governor Don Juan Marina the command that he come upon the
Charleston. He replied that, under Spanish law, he was not allowed to
go aboard a foreign man-of-war.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e5494width" id="p327"><img src="images/p327.jpg"

<p class="figureHead">Admiral Montojo, Commander of Spanish Fleet at

</div>
<p>Captain Glass then sent Lieutenant Brannersreuther to the Governor,
demanding an immediate and unconditional surrender. A half-hour was
allowed for the consideration of the demand. The Governor expressed
great surprise at these peremptory proceedings; but twenty-five minutes
after this demand he, nevertheless, made the unconditional surrender
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>of everything Spanish in and around the
Ladrones. The guns, ammunition, and flags of the Spaniards, as well as
the garrison and all the Spanish officers, were then taken aboard one
of the transports, and the expedition continued its journey
Manila-ward.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Cavit&eacute;: A Rebel Stronghold: Noted for Its
Arsenal.</p>
</div>
<p>It is said that, great was the rejoicing on board the cruiser and
the transports as the Stars and Stripes were unfurled from the Fort of
Santa Cruz; and, while the Charleston fired a salute of 21 guns,
Captain Glass formally declared the Ladrones to be possessions of the
United States.</p>
<p>Upon his arrival at Manila, by the transport Newport,&mdash;July
26th,&mdash;General Merritt immediately reported to Admiral Dewey, and,
establishing his headquarters in the Cavit&eacute; Arsenal, he assumed
command of all the American land-forces. He was officially recognized
by a salute of 13 guns. The three expeditions, respectively,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name=
"pb329">329</a>]</span>arrived a few days after one another, and all
were now awaiting the word of the Commander-in-chief. He at once
proceeded to inform himself of the situation.</p>
<p>Meantime, General Aguinaldo had removed his headquarters to Malolos.
He had also consolidated the divers insurrectionary parties in the
northeast provinces, by which he had gained an additional force of
5,000 men, and obtained control of the entire northern part of Luzon.
The insurgents, too, kept up a desultory fight, and were gradually
driving the Spaniards back. The latter possessed still a few outposts,
but these were for the most part but feebly defended, and it was indeed
a question of but a few days when the enemy would be driven within the
walls of the city. The insurgents were already building trenches on the
northern part of the city; they also held the water-works; and this,
inasmuch as the dry season was approaching, was most important.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Battle of Malate.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the night of Sunday, July 31st, occurred the first
loss of life of the Americans in the Philippine Islands. They had
thrown up earth-works not far from the Spanish trenches, which, soon
after dark, kept up a desultory fire.</p>
<p>The Americans began to reply in the American fashion, the men
standing up and exposing themselves to the Spanish fire. The most
dangerous place, of course, was the open ground just behind the
trenches; and here the greatest loss was incurred; for the
reinforcements, when crossing this open space, were wholly
unprotected.</p>
<div class="figure floatLeft xd21e5523width" id="p330"><img src=
"images/p330.jpg" alt="Alfonzo XIII., the Boy King of Spain." width=
"378" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">Alfonzo XIII., the Boy King of Spain.</p>
</div>
<p>It has been said that there was no need to reply to the Spanish
fire, as the intrenchment was sufficient protection. However, the First
Colorado and the First Nebraska regiments, who threw up the trenches,
suffered no loss whatever. No attention was paid to the Spanish fire at
that time; and it is a pity that this contemptuous indifference on the
part of the Americans was not maintained.</p>
<p>Subsequently, about the middle of July, the First Battalion of the
Californians pitched their tents at Tambo. This soon came to be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name=
"pb330">330</a>]</span>known as Camp Dewey. The Californians were soon
joined by the other American regiments, and outposts were stationed far
in front, near the insurgent line. The insurgents at this time were
between the Spaniards and the Americans; but, at General
Merritt&rsquo;s solicitation, Aguinaldo moved his position over to
Pasai, while the Americans advanced to the insurgent trenches.</p>
<p>These were soon found untenable, and it was Lieutenant-Colonel
McAvoy, who commanded the Colorado battalions, that was the first to
assume a position in front of the enemy. He advanced the line to an old
Capuchin chapel, that stood in the middle of the field, between the
Spanish position and the insurgent trenches.</p>
<p>The Colorado and Nebraska men, who threw up the new breast-works at
the point that Colonel McAvoy had chosen, were occasionally fired at by
the Spaniards, who had a good view of what the Americans were doing.
The breast-work was about seven feet high, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name="pb331">331</a>]</span>with
notches and peepholes for the lookouts. Inside the parapet was a
parallel elevation of about two feet&mdash;for the men to stand on when
they wished a shot at the enemy. The old chapel itself was in the line
of defense, and was used for cover; though it was nearly wrecked by the
many shells that had been thrown against it.</p>
<p>Saturday, July 30th, two batteries were placed in position: they
were A and B of the Utah Battalion. The guns of the former were placed
on the right, those of the latter on the left, of the chapel.</p>
<p>It was, accordingly, near Pasai, about ten o&rsquo;clock the same
day, that the first American blood was spilt. The First Colorado
regiment had just been relieved by the men from Nebraska, and were
returning to camp, when a Spanish bullet hit Private W. H. Sterling of
Company K. in the upper part of the left arm. The wound, however, was
very slight, and Sterling was soon back in the ranks.</p>
<p>Saturday night the Spaniards began a lively fusillade. But this did
no damage&mdash;the men were safe inside the newly-finished parapet.
The rain, in fact<span class="corr" id="xd21e5545" title=
"Not in source">,</span> made things far more uncomfortable than the
Spanish bullets. It fell in torrents, but the inventive Yankees tore up
the floor of the old chapel, and hastily built shelters, which
effectually kept off the water.</p>
<p>The Spanish trench was about 800 yards from the American
breast-works. It extended northeast, just in front of the old fort at
Malate, and was strengthened with rocks and sandbags. The land between
the two trenches was low and level. On Sunday night Spaniards advanced
beyond their works, began a heavy fire against the Americans, and drove
in the pickets of the Tenth Pennsylvania. The bullets began to fall
among the Americans, and the guns of Malate roared continuously. The
night is described as awful. From the skies fell tons of water, while
the wind blew with the force of a cyclone, howling and shrieking
through the swaying trees.</p>
<p>Major Cuthbertson was in command of the Pennsylvanians, and when the
pickets came in and reported that the enemy was trying to flank the
Americans, he ordered K and B companies into the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name=
"pb332">332</a>]</span>trench, and also commanded Major Bierer, who
commanded companies D and E, to the front.</p>
<p>The Spaniards, meanwhile, with their Mausers, kept up a terrific
fire, but the Americans and their Springfields soon began a vociferous
reply. The Utah artillerymen displayed remarkable coolness, and worked
their four guns like veterans. Though there was a perfect hail of
bullets, only one man was hit, and he but slightly wounded. The Spanish
fire was now concerted, and their bullets whistled, sang, and fell all
round the Americans. Most of them, however, were too high, though they
sounded dangerously near.</p>
<p>Across the open field, to the rear of the American trenches, now
came two companies, under the command of Major Bierer. It was here in
this unprotected field, swept by Mauser bullets, that the first
American lost his life. Corporal W. E. Brown, of Company D, Tenth
Pennsylvania, was the hero. He was shot through the body. Many others
around him were wounded, and, a few minutes later, Private William E.
Stillwagon was also killed. The men, notwithstanding, kept right on,
and continued to shoot; though, on account of the darkness, they could
not see the enemy; their fire, therefore, was not effective.</p>
<div class="figure floatRight xd21e5560width" id="p333"><img src=
"images/p333.jpg" alt="The Queen-regent of Spain." width="336" height=
"481">
<p class="figureHead">The Queen-regent of Spain.</p>
</div>
<p>At this juncture gallant Captain O&rsquo;Hara, in command of the
Third Artillery, still in camp, who knew that the boys in front must
soon be in want of ammunition, ordered his command to the rescue. And
they came in the nick of time. For the soldiers in the trenches had but
a few rounds of cartridges left. Many of the men, too, were shooting
wild; others, also, were somewhat demoralized; for the darkness, the
danger, and the uncertainty of the enemy were most disconcerting to raw
troops; but the example of Lieutenant Krayenbuhl and his regulars, who
kept up a steady fire, had good effect upon the volunteers; they soon
recovered themselves, and, with a rousing cheer, the whole command
moved onward.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, General Greene sent other reinforcements to the
front,&mdash;Colonel Smith, with part of his regiment, the First
California. As Boxton&rsquo;s battalion of Californians advanced
through the open field, they received the terrible Spanish fire, and
many were shot, and were left by the way. It was here that Captain
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name=
"pb333">333</a>]</span>Reinhold Richter, of Company I, was fatally
shot; and here, too, First Sergeant Morris Jurth, of Company A, was
killed. It was said that these Californians, not knowing of the
presence of the Pennsylvanians and of the regulars in front, fired
three volleys at them before the mistake was discovered. It is
believed, however, that no damage was done by the firing; but it was a
mistake that might have cost the Americans dearly. Meanwhile, two men
were killed in the trenches: Sergeant McIlrath, of Battery H., Tenth
Pennsylvania, who had recklessly exposed himself upon the parapet, and
Private Brady of Company I, the same regiment.</p>
<p>It was at this time that Private Finlay of Company C, First
California, gave proof of remarkable bravery. Finlay belonged to Major
Jones&rsquo; Transportation Department, and, on account of his
knowledge of Spanish, he had been put in charge of the ammunition-train
that was sent forward. In the train were eight carromatas, each in
charge of a native driver. Right through the open fields, where the
bullets fell thickest, he drove with his carromatas. The canvas-tops of
the carts were soon ripped into shreds, and one or two of the natives
were wounded; but the intrepid American kept right on toward the
trenches, and delivered his cartridges. But before he reached his
destination one of the ponies was killed. He merely took it out of the
cart, and, with the native driver, he pulled the cart up to the place
occupied by the others. On his return-journey he stopped to pick up the
dead and wounded that he found lying along the way, taking them to the
field-hospital in the rear, then received orders to take ten
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=
"pb334">334</a>]</span>carromatas and to go after all the wounded. This
he did as coolly as if he were loading his wagons with hay. Still, all
were tenderly cared for. The eight dead were buried in the yard of the
old convent of Maribacan, back of the camp. Every man was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name=
"pb335">335</a>]</span>sewed up in his blanket; to it was attached a
tag with his name for identification. The bodies were then all buried
in one trench, and above the grave of each man a headboard with his
name.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e5577width" id="p334"><img src="images/p334.jpg"
alt="Rear-Admiral George Dewey." width="549" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">Rear-Admiral George Dewey.</p>
</div>
<p>The chaplain of the Tenth Pennsylvania made careful observation of
the place, and of each grave.</p>
<p>About 2 o&rsquo;clock the Spaniards began to cease firing. The
Americans, on the other hand, kept up a lively rattle for a quarter of
an hour longer; but the engagement was about over; and General Greene,
who had followed the men to the front, returned to the camp. A few
desultory skirmishes took place for a day or two longer, in which two
men were killed; but the Spanish advance had been checked by the first
night&rsquo;s work, and by Monday morning the battle of Malate was
practically over. Altogether, the Americans lost ten killed and
forty-six wounded.</p>

<h3 class="main">Capture of Manila.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Nothing of importance occurred for several days after
the battle of Malate. Troops were landed on the Bacoor shore, and the
foreign warships took up their respective positions: the British and
the Japanese vessels near the American fleet, the French and the German
vessels on the other side of the bay. An ominous quiet brooded over
all.</p>
<p>On August 7th, the following letter was sent by General Merritt and
Admiral Dewey to General Jandenes:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first address"><i>To the General-in-Chief commanding the
Spanish Forces at Manila:</i></p>
<p><i>Sir: We have the honor to notify Your Excellency that operations
of the land and naval forces of the United States against the defenses
of Manila may begin at any time after the expiration of forty-eight
hours from the receipt by you of this communication, or sooner if made
necessary by attack on your part.</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb336" href="#pb336" name="pb336">336</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>This notice is given to afford you an opportunity to remove all
non-combatants from the city.</i></p>
<p class="signed"><i>Yours Respectfully</i>,<br>
<i>Wesley Merritt, Major-General U. S. A.</i>,<br>
<i>Commanding</i>.<br>
<i>George Dewey, Rear-Admiral U. S. N.</i>,<br>
<i>Commanding</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>To this the Spanish general replied in a polite note; that on
account of the fact that he was surrounded by the insurgents he was
without &ldquo;a place of refuge for the increased number of wounded,
sick, women, and children&rdquo; within the walls. He doubtless hoped
that his mention of this fact would put off the attack altogether.</p>
<p>And it did delay it for several days. However, General Merritt then
issued the following order, which was translated into Spanish:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">In view of the extraordinary conditions under which
this army is operating, the commanding general desires to acquaint the
officers and men with the expectations he entertains as to their
conduct.</p>
<p>You are assembled on foreign soil, situated within the western
confines of a vast ocean, separating you from your native land. You
have come not as despoilers or oppressors, but simply as the instrument
of a strong, free government, whose purposes are beneficent, and which
declared itself in this war champion of those oppressed by Spanish
misrule.</p>
<p>It is therefore the intention of this order to appeal directly to
your pride in your position as representatives of a high civilization,
in the hope and with the firm conviction that you will so conduct
yourself in your relation with the inhabitants of these islands as to
convince them of the lofty nature of the mission you have come to
execute.</p>
<p>It is not believed any acts of pillage, rapine or violence will be
committed by soldiers or others in the employ of the United States, but
should there be persons with this command who prove themselves unworthy
of this confidence, their acts will be considered not only as crimes
against the sufferers, but as direct insults to the United States Flag,
and be punished on the spot with the maximum penalties known to
military law.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name=
"pb337">337</a>]</span></p>
<p>It was decided to begin the attack on Saturday morning, August
13th.</p>
<p>Accordingly, a little before nine o&rsquo;clock the fleet began to
move in close to the city. The Olympia led the way, followed by the
Raleigh and the Petrel, while the Callao and the launch Barcelo hugged
the shore. The Monterey, with the Baltimore, Charleston, and Boston
formed the reserve. The ships were all cleared for action, and moved
majestically and silently forward. It was raining heavily.</p>
<p>Suddenly at twenty-five minutes of ten, the Olympia opened with her
8-inch guns. The first four shells were aimed at the Spanish fort at
Malate&mdash;known as San Antonia de Abad. On account of the rain it
was difficult to get the range, and so these first shells all fell
short. The Raleigh, Petrel, and Callao also opened upon the fort, and
as soon as the range was determined, the shots did great havoc, the
fort soon being rendered untenable.</p>
<p>The Callao, under Lieutenant Tappan, and the launch Barcelo, which
were nearer inshore, threw their shells among the Spanish riflemen, who
replied but feebly.</p>
<p>General Merritt and his staff and the color guard of the First
Oregon were on the despatch boat Zafiro.</p>
<p>General Anderson directed the operations on shore.</p>
<p>About twenty minutes after the bombardment began, General Greene,
with the left wing, began the land-attack, the advance being made
toward Malate, under cover of a heavy fire from the Utah Battery.</p>
<p>The troops, with colors flying, marched rapidly up the beach. The
bands were playing and the men rushed forward with a cheer. Six
companies of the Colorado regiment leaped over the enemy&rsquo;s
breast-work and took position behind some low hedges but a few hundred
feet from the Spanish line. General McArthur led the right wing, and
was ably supported by the Astor Battery, under Captain March. It
shelled a Spanish block-house with its Hotch-kiss Mountain guns, and
then gallantly charged the position with revolvers. It lost three men
killed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the bombardment had ceased, and the Colorados,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>the Californians, and the Eighteenth Regulars
drove back the Spaniards from Malate, and occupied the position, where
the Californians at once raised the Stars and Stripes.</p>
<p>In the suburbs of Malate and Ermita, where the Spaniards had erected
street barricades, there was now considerable street-fighting, and the
Californians, under Colonel Smith, advanced as far as the Luneta,
within 300 yards of the citadel. At this moment General Greene, with
several members of his staff, came galloping up the Luneta, a
scattering fire playing upon him and his companions from the adjoining
houses, until a white flag was raised above the southwest corner of the
fort.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Don Basilo Augustin: Spanish Captain-General of
the Philippine Islands.</p>
</div>
<p>At this,&mdash;and while the Americans were standing at
rest,&mdash;the Spaniards in the citadel opened fire upon them, fatally
wounding two Californians: privates Dunsoupe and Lamerson. This has
never been satisfactorily explained, but it was probably due to the
confusion of the moment; for 2000 Spaniards, retreating from Santa Ana
before a large body of insurgents, that were shooting at them, just
then came up, and it was to aid these that the Spaniards behind the
walls fired a volley after the flag of surrender had been raised.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=
"pb339">339</a>]</span></p>
<p>General Greene then ordered the retreating Spaniards inside the
walls, as a letter from the Captain-General was received inviting the
American commander within for a consultation. General Greene himself,
with Adjutant-General Bates, entered the city.</p>
<p>When General Merritt, on the Zafiro, saw the white flag, he sent
General Whittier, with Flag-Lieutenant Thomas M. Bramley, ashore to
meet the Captain-General to discuss the terms of surrender.</p>
<p>General Whittier found the Spanish officials much disturbed. Because
of the Spaniards seeking refuge in the city from the insurgents, it was
believed the Americans were continuing the attack.</p>
<p>When General Merritt himself entered the city, about three
o&rsquo;clock, the situation was explained, and a conference with
General Jandenes resulted in the following terms of capitulation.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Capitulation of the Philippines.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Officers allowed to retain their swords and personal
effects, but not their horses during their stay at Manila.</p>
<p>Prisoners of war surrendering their arms are to have necessary
supplies provided from the treasury; when that is exhausted the
Americans to make provision.</p>
<p>All public property is surrendered. Future disposition of Spanish
troops surrendered is to be determined by negotiations between the
respective governments.</p>
<p>Arms may be returned at General Merritt&rsquo;s discretion.</p>
<p>Banks will continue to operate under existing regulations, subject
to change by the United States Government.</p>
<p>General Jandenes, it is said, was found in the sacristy of a church,
which was filled with women and children. The capitulation, however,
was made and signed in the adjacent municipal buildings.</p>
<p>The terms of capitulation were formally signed by the American
commissioners: General Greene, Colonel Whittier, Colonel Crowder, and
Captain Lamberton; and the Spanish commissioners Colonel San
Jos&eacute; Maria Laguen, Felix Don Carlos Reye, and General Don
Nicolas de la Pena y Cuellas. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340"
href="#pb340" name="pb340">340</a>]</span></p>
<p>The insurgents were barred from the city. At dusk General Augustin,
the Captain-General of the Islands, and his family, escaped on a German
cruiser to Hong-Kong.</p>

<p class="figureHead">General Wesley Merritt, American Commander of the

</div>
<p>Lieutenant Bramley lowered the Spanish flag on Fort Santiago,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name=
"pb341">341</a>]</span>and raised the Stars and Stripes. It is said
that while this momentous ceremony was performing, many of the
Spaniards looking on wept; while the American band played the
Star-Spangled Banner, and the surrounding American troops presented
arms.</p>
<p>The Americans suffered a loss of eight killed and forty wounded. The
exact Spanish loss has never been ascertained, but it was probably not
far from 500 killed and wounded. The Americans took 20,000 Mauser
rifles, 3,000 Remingtons, a large number of cannon and 11,000
prisoners; 7,000 of them Spanish regulars.</p>
<p>American sentries were at once placed on the battlements and along
the Pasig, and perfect order was maintained.</p>
<p>It was found, further, that the stories of starvation were grossly
exaggerated; both the inhabitants and the soldiers were looking very
well. Most of them, in fact, seemed to be pleased that the surrender
had been made so soon, without great loss of life, and before a
continued bombardment had reduced the city to ruins.</p>
<p>General Merritt and chief of staff, General Babcock, deserved great
credit for their plan of attack, which was carried out successfully
under great disadvantages. The conduct of the Americans, officers and
men alike, army and navy, was most creditable.</p>
<p>Because the protocol establishing peace between the United States
and Spain had been signed a few hours before the capture of Manila, it
was believed that the United States was bound by the third article of
the protocol, which reads:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The United States will occupy and hold the city, bay,
and harbor of Manila pending the conclusion of a treaty of peace, which
shall determine the control, disposition, and government of the
Philippines.</p>
</div>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Awaiting the Peace Commission.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Thus Spain was to remain the nominal possessor of the
Archipelago, until the decision of the Peace Commission.</p>
<p>Pending the conclusion of the peace negotiations, and the
disposition of the islands, it was settled that the authority of the
United <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342</a>]</span>States was to be supreme. Both Spaniards, and
insurgents were thus to have no share in the Government. The Americans
were conquerors; the Spaniards, as the conquered, had lost all right to
a voice in public affairs. There was, however, some doubt on the part
of the American commands as to the status of the insurgents; who,
though they had but little part in the capture of Manila, had done
effective work in other parts of Luzon, having driven the common enemy
step by step to the gates of the capital. The revolution, too, was
spreading, and new complications arose every day.</p>
<p>In reply to their joint-message for instructions, General H. C.
Corbin cabled General Merritt as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">INSTRUCTIONS TO MERRITT.</p>
<p class="dateline">Adjutant-General&rsquo;s Office, Washington, D. C.,
August 17, 1898.</p>
<p>Major-General Merritt, Manila, Philippine Islands:&mdash;The
President directs that there must be no joint-occupation with the
insurgents.</p>
<p>The United States is in the possession of Manila city, Manila bay
and harbor, and must preserve the peace and protect persons and
property within the territory occupied by their military and naval
forces.</p>
<p>The insurgents and all others must recognize the military occupation
and authority of the United States and the cessation of hostilities
proclaimed by the President.</p>
<p>Use whatever means in your judgment are necessary to this end. All
law-abiding people must be treated alike.</p>
<p>By order of the Secretary of War.</p>
